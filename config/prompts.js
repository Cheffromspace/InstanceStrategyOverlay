Please use the following HTML tags to highlight important information:
- Wrap ability names in <span class="ability">...</span>
- Wrap important mechanics in <span class="mechanic">...</span>
- Wrap boss names or phases in <span class="boss">...</span>

Feel free to use unicode emojis to represent common game mechanics like tankbusters or party-wide damage. Examples include:
For tankbusters: 🛡️
For party-wide damage: 💥
For adds: 🎯
For tethers: 🔗
For movement: 🏃
For stacking: 🤝
For spread: 🌐
For line AoE: ➡️⬅️

This summary will be displayed in the game's HUD, so please:
Use a clear, bullet-point format.
Omit any chat assistant commentary.
Keep the summary concise, aiming for a high-level overview.
Separate each boss and phase into their own section.
Don't add any unessecary spacing or line breaks. Keep formatting clean and concise. Never use any blank lines.

Example summary:
- <span class="ability">Minimum</span>: 🔗 Tethers removed by having players <span class="mechanic">🏃 move close together</span>
- <span class="ability">Tidal Wave</span>: Unavoidable 💥 party-wide damage, <span class="mechanic">🩹 heal through it</span>
- <span class="ability">Elemental Converter</span>: <span class="mechanic">🎯 Kill adds </span>to prevent it from being drained`;
