There is also a blue magitek robot which 1 or 2 raiders can choose to mount into.The Magitek armor mount has the ability to deal damage to the enemy, put a vulnerability debuff on the enemy, and most importantly, have the ability to drag the bombs which will spawn. The bombs have a wide explosion radius and stack a fire damage taken debuff on anyone hit.Players can fight the enemies on one side of the arena so that the bomb can be taken to the opposite corner and prevent raid damage. With current stats, this is not necessary, as the bombs only inflict minor damage if they explode.Recommended kill order:1)Red Magitek Suits of ArmorBoomtype Magitek GobwalkerThese enemies can inflict debuffs on the raid, they are a priority to kill.2)Tall Robot KnightsJagd DollsNot overly difficult, just can cause a lot of damage if not careful.3)Big GoblinsGordian Hardhelms and Gordian HardmindsAgain, not much of a threat, but they have more health than the smaller enemies4)Little GoblinsGordian Soldiers and Gordian SnipersMore trash mobs, deal with them to reduce the number of enemies attacking the tank.5)Gigantic Robot MachinesMagitek Gobwidow G-IXSave these for last, they are easy enough to take down, but have an AOE. IF only one is spawned, tank it separately from the rest of the enemies until they are dealt with. Otherwise try to avoid having many of these in one area.Loot1Precision Gordian Lens(Guaranteed)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Gordian LensOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Gordian ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Gordian PedalOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Gordian BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Gordian CrankOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Gordian SpringOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Gordian PedalOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Gordian BoltOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Gordias II10Discover every location withinAlexander: Gordias - the Cuff of the Father.-3.01RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
