Upon first glance, the shade of its maw might appear inviting to one who seeks to escape the punishing rays of the midday sun. However, any good woodcutter knows to keep his distance, for it is said all who enter, never return - the cries of the damned echoing up from the depths the only testament to their folly. Heed this dire warning, and you may live.

The right path is a dead end containing only enemies and no bonus treasure coffer.In the section between the first and second bosses, the party will again progress by interacting withShifting Sands. However, these are available from the start, andthe party does not need to kill any enemies along the way, although they will be aggroed. It should be communicated to the party beforehand, however, to decide whether to skip the enemies. Note that any players who get left behind and die can Release to the start of the dungeon. The rest of the party can engage the second boss. The left behind player(s) will be given an option to teleport into the boss room.The section before the last boss contains two branching paths with a treasure coffer in each one. Many parties will skip these.BossesCutter's Cry GuideMyrmidon PrincessMyrmidon Princess is the first boss of Cutter's Cry. Her main abilities include:Mandible Biteis a frontal cone AoE attack that damages all targets within.Silenceis a spell used toSilencea party member for a short time.Trap Jawsis an instant melee attack.Hasteis a spell used by the Myrmidon Princess to increase the attack speed of her adds.At around half health Myrmidon Princess will summon 3 types of adds to aid her in combat:Myrmidon Marshalis the most dangerous add type. It has an AoE frontal cone ability, Mandible Bite, that damages all targets caught within. The Marshal can also use an ability named Formic Pheromones, which puts a healing-over-time buff on Myrmidon Princess.Myrmidon Guardis the 2nd add type. It also has Mandible Bite, the frontal AoE cone ability.Myrmidon Soldieris the least dangerous add type. It only has a basic attack.It is recommended to kill Myrmidon Marshal first, Myrmidon Guard second, and Myrmidon Soldiers last.Giant Tunnel WormGiant Tunnel Worm is the humongous worm boss of Cutter's Cry. Throughout the fight, it will submerge underneath the sandy grounds of the boss room. The worm is the most dangerous when it is submerged. The worm's main abilities include:Sandstormis an instant frontal attack that deals a small amount of damage.Sand Cycloneis a spell that targets a random party member. It does a small amount of damage and inflicts a damage over time debuff.Sand Pillaris used when it is burrowed. Sand Pillar damages any player standing on top of the sand trap.Earthbreakis used when it is burrowed. Tunnel Worm explodes out of the ground and heavily damages anyone near it.Bottomless Desertis used by the Worm when it is burrowed. It appears as a whirlwind on the ground, does small amount of damage and pulls all party members towards its center.Sludgeis a single-target ability used by the Worm. It inflicts a heavySludgeDoT (~200 HP per tick) on a player which should be removed as soon as possible.Target prioritydoes not seem to factor in who gets attacked.Spreading out when the worm submerges reduces the chance that multiple party members will be hit when it emerges from the sand. It is important that after it does the Bottomless Desert that adventurers move out of the center to not get hit when the worm emerges.ChimeraThe final boss of Cutter's Cry, the Chimera requires close attention to know where to step. The Chimera has a frontal cone cleave calledLion's Breaththat deals a moderate amount of fire damage. Occasionally the Chimera will use the abilitiesRam's BreathandDragon's Breath. Ram's Breath causes ice damage andHeavyon the right side of its body and Dragon's Breath causes thunder damage andParalysison the left side of its body. Melee DPS can stand directly behind the Chimera to avoid these cones, but the tank will have to move left or right to sidestep their effects. Most of Chimera's attacks willParalyze its target, which can be cleansed withEsuna, but Adventurers with low HP should be extra careful.At 75% of its life, the Chimera will begin to use two attacks calledThe Dragon's Voice[1]andThe Ram's Voice[1]. When players see one of the two messages below in the chat log, they need to either move closer to the boss or away from it:When the Chimera's eyes glow violet- When using Dragon's Voice, a thundercloud AoE attack that damages and inflictsParalysis on everyone outside of Chimera's melee range. Ranged DPS and healers should move toward the boss immediately.When the Chimera's eyes glow blue- When using Ram's Voice, an ice AoE attack that damages and inflcitsHeavy on everyone in Chimera's melee range. Tanks and melee DPS should move away from him as soon as possible.The Chimera will randomly begin targeting adventurers with two new abilities as well:Cacophony- The Chimera sends out a purple ball of energy that travels to the target and explodes. That party member targeted by this ability should move away from the ball immediately. If the ball hits a player while it is traveling, it will explode immediately. The explosion not only damages players but also inflictsParalysis on them.Ram's Keeper- The Chimera spits an ice orb that flies from the Chimera to one random player. It triggers a ground indicator that inflictsDeep Freezeand will leave an icy patch at that location.[1]Blue Magescan learn these spells.BestiaryNameDropsArkose GolemCanyon CondorChimeraGiant Tunnel

Cry.-2.0ImagesChimeraLoreThe Devourer Of DarklightNear an old mountain path used by woodcutters as a detour through the more perilous stretches of northern Thanalan lies a cave sought out only by the ignorant or the foolish. Upon first glance, the shade of its maw might appear inviting to one who seeks to escape the punishing rays of the midday sun. However, any good woodcutter knows to keep his distance, for it is said that those who enter never return—the cries of the damned echoing, up from the depths the only testament to their folly.As the Sixth Astral Era drew to a close, Cutter's Cry claimed for its legend a vaunted name—that of the Darklight Raiders. Hardened warriors all, it was believed that they would make short work of the fiends within, but none would return from that mission save for one man. This survivor, Sibold, spoke of their ill-fated encounter with the dread chimera, who slew all of his comrades, even their inimitable leader, Gerbald the Red. While his memory of the battle was hazy, the creature’s disappearance afterwards led some to believe that the Darklight Raiders may have triumphed after all, albeit at a high price.Years later, following the Calamity, unsettling reports began to emerge that the chimera's spine-chilling growl could be heard deep within the cave once more...The ChimeraFor its insatiable appetite for manflesh, this abominable specimen was given the name "Craver" by woodcutters. Despite suffering grievous wounds in its encounter with the Darklight Raiders, it survived to make a fall recovery and resumed its reign of terror. While presumed to trace its origins from the chimerical creations of the Allagan Empire, it is not known how it came to inhabit Cutter's Cry.The Myrmidon PrincessAn antling species native to Thanalan, myrmidon society is centered around a queen. When an heir—the princess—is born, the queen goes into exile, taking half the colony with her, while the rest remain to serve her successor.MoreCarved splendidly smooth by erosion, the rock formations are a sight to behold, but one would do well not to admire them overlong —lest she become fodder for fell fiends.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
