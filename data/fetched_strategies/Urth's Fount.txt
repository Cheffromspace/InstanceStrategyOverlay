While most of the rumors have since been deemed unfounded, there is one series of events that has remained difficult to cast off as merely the ravings of broken-minded smallfolk: that concerning the supposed Dark Rider of the Shroud. After several deaths attributed to this mysterious figure, SeedseerO-App-Pesisought communion with the spirits of the Twelveswood, only to learn that the rider was none other than the elder primalOdin. Slain in the Third Astral Era by an Allagan hero, why and how the primal has returned toEorzearemains a mystery─one now in the capable hands of Eorzea's adventurers.— In-game descriptionUrth's Fountis a level 50trialintroduced inpatch 2.5.Contents1Strategy1.1The Dark Divinity: Odin2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer3Achievements4ImagesStrategyThe Dark Divinity:OdinHall of Sorrow: Raid-wide magical damage. Used periodically.Hall of Lead: Targets 3 random party members (never MT) with a medium circle AoE, dealing magical damage and inflicting a curable 10sSlowon all affected targets.Hall of Stone: Targets random party members with an avoidable circle AoE, leaving ~2s to run out. Deals damage and inflicts an incurable 8sPetrificationon anyone that get struck. The initial cast targets three party members, the second targets four, and later casts will target five. A second set of circles can also appear immediately after the first.Einherjar: Raid-wide magical damage with a 3s cast time. Inflicts a curable 30sBleedon the party. First Einherjar is followed by Gungnir immediately after. Second Einherjar has no Gungnir near. Third Einherjar happens after the second Gungnir's gone down and after Odin uses Sanngetal.Valknut: Telegraphed, medium-sized circle AoE around Odin. Anyone struck will take damage equal to 60% of their max HP. Used periodically, but guaranteed after each Gungnir.Sanngetall: Tankbuster with a 3s cast time. Should be mitigated, as it happens once 30 seconds; the off-tank can also Provoke right after it hits.Gagnrath: Red spears appear on the outside of the arena and dash across in a straight line. Anyone struck will be damaged and knocked back roughly 1/3rd of the arena. There are two patterns: three lines from one direction, or one line from two perpendicular directions forming a cross pattern. Later into the fight, each pattern gets a follow-up attack: the first gets two lines from the opposite direction filling in the gaps, and the second gets a follow-up cross attack. Valknut often happens during these Gagnrath attacks.Gungnir: Three random party members (never MT) are targeted with a large circle AoE. After 3~5s, Gungnirs drop down on the targets for physical damage. Note that Hall of Sorrow goes off at the same time as the Gungnirs go off. Gungnir also inflicts a raid-wideBleedfor as long as the three spears remain alive.Shin-Zantetsuken: Hard enrage; starts the cast at about 15% HP, or after 6 minutes. Takes 30s to cast and roughly 7s to execute.Rotations:Einherjar → Gungnir → Valknut → Sanngetal (first time)Gungnir → Valknut → Sanngetal → Einherjar (second time)LootSee also:Odin Glamour SetTreasure Coffer15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsOdin Card(Drops at a fixed rate)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDark Divinity HjalmrHead50BGreen1Dark Divinity AugaHead50BGreen1Dark Divinity HerklaediBody50BGreen1Dark Divinity FeldrBody50BGreen1Dark Divinity HanzkarHands50BGreen1Dark Divinity BrokLegs50BGreen1Dark Divinity SpjarrarLegs50BGreen1Dark Divinity SkorFeet50BGreen1Faded Copy of The Corpse HallOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMissed the Cut10DefeatOdinatUrth's Fount.The Unsevered2.5ImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
