As time passed, the very route to the Inner Fist became a grueling test for those hoping to train their body and soul atop the perilous mountain. Now the time has come for you to follow in their footsteps. Accompanied by an avid scholar named Marjorie, you focus your sights on the temple and steel yourself for the trials that lie ahead.— In-game descriptionThe Temple of the Fistis a level 70dungeonintroduced inpatch 4.0withStormblood.Contents1Objectives2Notes3Bosses3.1Coeurl Sruti3.2Arbuda3.3Ivon Coeurlfist4Loot4.1Coeurl Smriti4.2Arbuda4.3Ivon Coeurlfist4.4Additional Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 9.6 Y: 14.4)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 12.4 Y: 13.9)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 12.1 Y: 9.4)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 14.0 Y: 8.0)5Achievements6Images7Lore7.1The Path To Rhalgr7.2Arbuda7.3Ivon Coeurlfist7.4MoreObjectivesClear Rhalgr's Shoulder: 0/1Defeat thecoeurls: 0/1Arrive at Harmony: 0/1DefeatArbuda: 0/1Clear the Closed Fist: 0/1DefeatIvon Coeurlfist: 0/1NotesDespite the claims of NPCs, there really aren't that many traps in the dungeon per se - most of the danger comes from mobs. That said, there are a few stone pistons on the upper pathways that you'll want to avoid. They have clearly marked AoEs though, so they're very easy to dodge.Only other thing you really need to watch out for are the giant blobs of moss in the early phases (tripping over these inflictsSlow/Heavyfor a few seconds), and the Spirit Flames in the latter stage. The Spirit Flames are non-targetable enemies and work much like the Bombfish inShisui of the Violet Tides, except they home in on a player first.BossesThe Temple of the Fist Video GuideCoeurl SrutiCoeurl Sruti is a straight forward Boss. His attack are based on claws and jumping without a marker, though he will also use an AoE around him calledRadial Blaster; if you get hit by it, you gain stacks of "Magical Damage received up". Also uses theBlue MagespellBasic Instinct.At around 77% he will summon his minionCoeurl Smritiwho will claw and jump around like Coeurl Sruti. Instead of Radial Blaster, he usesWindblasterin a cone of aprox 150° in front of him.Smriti has health comparable to Sruti, so you should treat this like the Giruveganaus fight inThe Stone Vigil (Hard); focus on the wounded Sruti and finish him off, then engage Smriti.Around every 20% Coeurl Sruti will castElectric Blaster, which places purple markers on players. After a short time, there will be an AoE Thunder hit on the marker that applies "Physical Damage received up".ArbudaArbudais a massive, four-armed, sword-wielding statue with powerful attacks, and is best tanked at one end of the arena. Non-tank players should stand at approximately 45 degrees off any of Arbuda's cardinal directions; if you consider his front heading to be 0 degrees, you want to be at 45, 135, 225. or 315. This ensures you'll have plenty of time to reposition to avoid two of Arbuda's main attacks.Port and Star: Massive unmarked cone AoE to Arbuda's left and right sides. Inflicts considerable damage and knockback. Stand in front or behind him.Fore and Aft:  Massive unmarked cone AoE to Arbuda's front and back sides. Inflicts considerable damage and knockback. Stand to either side of him.Fourfold Shear: is a slice on the tank, even if you move Arbuda follows you so buff up and get healed.Hellseal: Works identically to the Liquid Flame's 'Seal of Night and Day' from Great Gubal Library (Hard). Simply move to the corresponding glowing symbol to dodge the attack. The timing is fairly tight, but the damage tick doesn't apply the instant the cast ends, so you have a little wiggle room.Tapas: Places invisible markers on every and chases them with AoE bursts.Killer Instinct: Arbuda assumes a defensive stance, similiar toRavana. 1 side will be open to attack; attacking any other side will cause him to parry the attack back at you - even spells can be deflected. Whilst this is active, he is also capable of parrying area-effect Limit Breaks.Ivon CoeurlfistA powerful ancient monk in search of worthy challengers, Ivon is a formidable challenge even for veteran adventurers.Spirit Wave: Drop a whirlwind with an AoE Windzone on one random player, typically Ranged DPS or the Healer. Just move out of it. Doesn't last very long.Hurricane Kick: A short-ranged 270° roundhouse kick AoE, front-facing, leaving a 90° safe-spot for melee. Inflicts Stun for a short time if it hits you.Touch of Slaughter: Marks one player at random and knocks them down to 1 HP, typically either the Tank or one of the DPS. Rarely directly fatal by itself, but healers should heal the victim up immediately.Rhalgr's Piece:  places a mine that causes AoE damage if triggered, best move away to the outer edge of the platform.The Rose of Destruction: Will mark one player with a large orange crosshair marker, requiring the party to stack to split damage.Furious Fist: Ivon begins powering up for a super attack, filling the room with glowing chakra orbs that are tethered to him. Collecting the orbs reduces the strength of this attack and will grant you a short-lived stackingDamage Upbuff. Once the cast completes, Ivon will float over the center of the arena and punch down around 4-5 times, followed by a finishingImpactstrike that does significantly more damage. If all orbs are collected, the first barrage will be around 1,500 damage for each hit, and the final hit will be around 12,000 damage.Silent Roar: will mark one player and casts a tidalwave towards that player. Getting hit by the wave will knock you back with a chance to fall offIvon will also periodically summon glowing white heads that travel across the room, similar to the walls of mummies inThe Sunken Temple of Qarn (Hard). These aren't too hard to avoid as they are fairly slow-moving. Later on he'll summon two waves at once, crossing the arena perpendicular to each other.LootSee also:Crimson Lotus Weapons,Arhat ArmorandArhat AccessoriesCoeurl Smriti4Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNo

of the Sixth Umbral Calamity, it is said that Rhalgr sent a star to guide the forebears of the Ala Mhigan people to safety in the mountains of Gyr Abania. The ground where the star came to its rest was held as sacred and drew pilgrims from far and wide. Seeking to be closer to the Destroyer, this loose congregation of worshipers built a temple at the summit of a mountain by carving back the bare rock. Thus was born the Temple of the Fist, the main bastion of the Fist of Rhalgr.Ere long, the climb to pay pilgrimage to the temple came to be regarded as part of the spiritual journey for the faithful, and for this purpose a dedicated path was created: the Way of Enlightenment. Yet this was no leisurely stroll. Aside from being precariously steep, the way was outfitted with an array of traps and obstacles which tested flesh and faith both. In time, this grueling route would be adopted as a trial for those who aspired to monkhood.Alas, the Fist of Rhalgr would incur the wrath of King Theodoric, who saw the Temple of the Fist razed and its inhabitants slaughtered. Imperial rule further saw all religious practices oppressed, and for two decades nary a soul has set foot within its grounds.ArbudaThis four-armed golem was created to train monks, who competed to defeat it in the shortest possible time. Contests were awarded ranks, named for various beasts which were, in ascending order: mossling, chapuli, gazelle, coeurl, griffin, and two-headed coeurl. One last rank exists to crown them all, and it is named for the Destroyer Himself.Ivon CoeurlfistA legend among monks, Ivon Coeurlfist honed his martial prowess by wandering the mountains and fighting coeurls. He is also credited for creating a powerful pair of gloves made from the hide of coeurls. According to scripture, such was his dedication to his faith and art that, even after his death, his essence persisted in the corporeal realm to continue his training forevermore. There are reports that an adventurer fought his spirit in the Temple of the Fist, but there is little in the way of details.MoreWithin the innermost sanctum of the temple lies a chamber named Guidance. Scripture holds that those who make it this far are given the chance to prove themselves further—against the spirit of a great monk of eld.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
