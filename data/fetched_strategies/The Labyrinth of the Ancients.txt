As a result the guide below includes mechanics that players will normally not experience unless on Minimum IL mode.Bone DragonUpdated Labyrinth of the Ancients GuideLabyrinth of the Ancients Guide Part 1Labyrinth of the Ancients Guide Part 2Bone Dragon is the 1st boss of the Labyrinth of the Ancients. Players will encounter the Dragon when they take the left path from the entrance. Bone Dragon must be killed 3 times before it is finally defeated.The arena has platforms similar to previous rooms. Poison will occasionally fill all lower areas of the room so be aware of this. The boss will spawn 3 waves of skeleton adds, which should be killed. Once the bone dragon dies, all skeleton adds will respawn and move towards the dragon. If two skeletons were close to each other when they died, they will move too fast to be killed. Each skeleton that reaches the boss will do 1500 unblockable damage to the raid. This phase will repeat once. The second time the dragon comes back to life, he will spawn floating eyes instead. These should be picked up by tanks but dps should focusing on killing boss instead of adds then the dragon will die for good this time.Tank the Bone Dragon on the center platform. This allows for an even spread of adds around the room, while minimizing confusion on where to pull the adds as 1 spawns per "path". This will also reduce damage taken by the DPS, as they will spend more time on the raised sections out of the poison.Kill skeletons before they reach dragon.Pick the floating eyes, leave them with tank onlyAtomosThe raid will need to divide into their 3 groups based on their party (A, B, C): 1 for each path, which each has a platform. 4 people need to stand on each platform (preferably ranged dps and healers) to allow the other groups to kill Atomos. Atomos does not need to be tanked but will continuously spawn adds that should be killed. The tanks should move these adds within range of the players on the platforms.Note: Do not cross the purple line before the alliance has all arrived, that will start the encounter and force the late players to teleport into the left chamber.4 people stand on each colored platform, which will remove the corresponding color-coded barrier around an Atomos from a different party, making it vulnerable. The other four focus on killing Atomos.Note that if a sector does not contain enough people to stand on the platform, once the room is sealed, several Iron Giants will spawn and quickly wipe the raid in order for the encounter to reset.It is common for A, B, and Cwaymarksto be placed from left to right in front of the entrance to a sector as a reminder for where to go based on your party.ThanatosThanatos is the 3rd boss of the dungeon. Players will encounter the boss when they take the right path from the labyrinth entrance.Thanatos is a ghostly iron giant that is surrounded by three Magic Pots on the corner of his chamber. The Magic Pots are friendly mobs, and should be healed if they're damaged. If all three die, then you will be unable to harm the boss and will wipe. (For typical Duty Finder runs, it is usually not necessary to heal the Magic Pots due to the speed at which the boss is killed.)Thanatos is “ghostly” and cannot be harmed ordinarily.  At the beginning of the fight, one of the Magic Pots will shoot green lines out to several alliance members, giving them an buff calledAstral Realignment. The first group to receive the buff is always A.Astral Realignmentallows you to deal damage to the boss. A tank with the buff should pick up the boss immediately, and a tank swap should occur whenever a tank picks upAstral Realignmentand the one on the boss loses it. Thanatos does have a cleave, so he should be faced away from the group and the pots.Anyone who doesn't haveAstral Realignmentshould focus on killing the adds that spawn throughout the fight. They will charge the Pots and attack, and occasionally will have a red line connecting them to a pot.  Anytime you see this, these adds must be killed immediately.  While that red line is active, Thanatos will be pulling the Pot to himself with a giant Holmgang chain -- if he gets it to him, he will kill it pretty fast.  Once the adds connected to the Pot die and the Pot is healed, it can escape back to its safe spot.This fight progresses fairly straightforwardly from here, just repeating the basic mechanics until he dies or all three Pots die.If you haveAstral Realignment, DPS the boss. If you're visible, kill adds. Healers should keep the pots alive.The party should avoid pulling the boss early (at least until Alliance A has arrived) as this can potentially cause some players in A to miss the buff, prolonging the fight.Allagan BombAllagan Bomb initially does nothing. Each group takes one of the large sword adds (A left, B north, C right - waymarks may sometimes be used to denote each party's add). ThoseVassagosWILL NOT aggro anyone automatically, so each tank should stand in front of each adds to avoid the boss running to the middle. The boss will periodically spawn Allagan Balloon adds that need to be killed (high priority) before they reach the center, or they will explode and cause the Allagan Bomb to enlarge.  If the bomb enlarges too much, it will explode and wipe the raid. In addition, a Napalm add may spawn and will have the highest priority to kill. The boss can be damaged once the 3 adds are down.A Vassago will get invulnerability if it has too little HP compared to the healthiest Vassago.Non-tanks should not be directly in front of a Vassago, because they will periodically used untelegraphed frontal cleaves.Kill Priority for adds: Napalm first, Balloon second and Sword third.King BehemothKing Behemoth is the 3rd boss of the raid. Players will encounter Behemoth when they take the center path from the entrance.Iron Giantadds will spawn early in the fight. The tanks who are not tanking the boss should pick these up and face them away from other players or meteors that drop later, as they will use untelegraphed frontal cleaves.The arena contains interact-able towers. Each tower should be covered by one ranged DPS or healer, activating it when it begins to glow. (For a typical Duty Finder run, this mechanic can be ignored).The only mechanic that is likely to kill unsuspecting players isEcliptic Meteor. King Behemoth will target a few players with a comet (green mark above head). These players should be outside the boss's hitbox and drop the comet to be used later. Adds will continually spawn and attempt to reach the towers. These need to be killed as soon as possible. In addition, an iron giant will spawn that will try to destroy the comets. The giant needs to be killed before all comets are destroyed or you will wipe. When King Behemoth stands up, it will begin castingEcliptic Meteor. Each player must stand behind a meteor to block line-of-sight with the boss, of they will instantly die. Rinse and repeat and the fight is done.Comets that are placed inside the hitbox of the Behemoth will not provide protection from Ecliptic Meteor.PhlegethonPhlegethon is the final boss of Labyrinth of the Ancients. The boss room is unlocked from defeating the other 3 bosses.Each group should take a position ahead of time (A on the left, B center, C on the right) before pulling the boss - it is common for A, B, and C waymarks to be placed on the appropriate platforms.Non-tanks should avoid standing in front of Phlegethon due to its untelegraphed frontal cleave. Aside from this, it will use some clearly telegraphed AoEs to avoid.Phlegethon has only 1 big move to watch out for:Ancient Flare. At around 40-50% HP, Phlegethon will move to the center and start casting Ancient Flare. Each group needs to immediately move to its assigned platform. Doing this will put up a barrier to block his 'Ancient Flare' attack, which is otherwise a wipe. If there is not enough people on each platform, the barrier will not form, and the raid will wipe. At around 5-15% HP, he will do this again; either run back to the platform to repeat the mechanic or burn him down (do so if he starts the cast with < 6% HP).During the fight adds will spawn, and should be killed. Iron Hand adds stun a nearby target.It may be useful for healers toRescueplayers who may be lagging behind when running to the platform.LootSee also:The Labyrinth of the Ancients ArmorBone Dragon10Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBallad BootsFeet80CBlue1Ballad CrownHead80CBlue1Crimson HatHead80CBlue1Crimson ShoesFeet80CBlue1Crown of LightHead80CBlue1Fuma GantaiHead80CBlue1Fuma KyahanFeet80CBlue1Onion BootsFeet80CBlue1Onion MaskHead80CBlue1Royal CrownHead80CBlue1Royal ShoesFeet80CBlue1Sabatons of LightFeet80CBlue1Thanatos20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBallad GauntletsHands80CBlue1Ballad SarouelLegs80CBlue1Breeches of LightLegs80CBlue1Crimson BreechesLegs80CBlue1Crimson Celestial GlovesHands80CBlue1Fuma HakamaLegs80CBlue1Fuma TekkoHands80CBlue1Gauntlets of LightHands80CBlue1Onion GauntletsHands80CBlue1Onion SarouelLegs80CBlue1Royal BreechesLegs80CBlue1Royal Celestial GlovesHands80CBlue1King Behemoth30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityArmor of LightBody80CBlue1Ballad BootsFeet80CBlue1Ballad CorseletBody80CBlue1Crimson ShoesFeet80CBlue1Crimson VestBody80CBlue1Fuma KoromoBody80CBlue1Fuma KyahanFeet80CBlue1Onion ArmorBody80CBlue1Onion BootsFeet80CBlue1Royal ShoesFeet80CBlue1Royal VestBody80CBlue1Sabatons of LightFeet80CBlue1Phlegethon40Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsPhlegethon Card(Drops at a fixed rate)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAllagan CatalystMaterialN/AABasic1Armor of LightBody80CBlue1Ballad CorseletBody80CBlue1Ballad CrownHead80CBlue1Ballad GauntletsHands80CBlue1Ballad SarouelLegs80CBlue1Breeches of LightLegs80CBlue1Crimson BreechesLegs80CBlue1Crimson Celestial GlovesHands80CBlue1Crimson HatHead80CBlue1Crimson VestBody80CBlue1Crown of LightHead80CBlue1Faded Copy of HubrisOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Faded Copy of Tumbling DownOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Fuma GantaiHead80CBlue1Fuma HakamaLegs80CBlue1Fuma KoromoBody80CBlue1Fuma TekkoHands80CBlue1Gauntlets of LightHands80CBlue1Onion ArmorBody80CBlue1Onion GauntletsHands80CBlue1Onion MaskHead80CBlue1Onion SarouelLegs80CBlue1Royal BreechesLegs80CBlue1Royal Celestial GlovesHands80CBlue1Royal CrownHead80CBlue1Royal VestBody80CBlue1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDimension Blade FragmentMaterialN/AABasic1RewardsWhen originally released, players could receive only one reward item per week for completing duties in The Labyrinth of the Ancients.
