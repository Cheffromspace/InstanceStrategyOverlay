Look away to avoid status infliction.At the end of this phase, Yol will retreat and spawn a Corpsecleaner Eagle. Once the first is killed, Yol will spawn one more and after killing it Yol will return to the arena. During this time, Yol will periodically appear the edge of the arena, performing line AoE attacks with no markers. Move out from in front of Yol when it appears to avoid damage.Phase 2WingbeatMarks a player with a green marker. The marked player will be knocked to the outer edge of the arena. Get back to the center of the arena to avoid outer AoEs.At the start of this phase, Yol's wings will become targetable and Yol will become untargetable. Players must kill both wings to proceed. During this time, Yol will spawn three circular AoEs that will rotate clock-wise around the outer edge of the arena. Players should stay close to the center to avoid these. Once Yol's wings are shattered, the fight's mechanics will repeat until Yol is defeated.Note:This phase can be entirely skipped with a well-timed Limit Break just before Yol starts his second phase. Yol's retreats are usually pre-faced with a cast of Wind Unbound, with the first retreat (which turns into the Phase 2 retreat if Yol's HP is below a certain threshold) occurring 2 mechanics after Eye of the Fierce (Eye of the Fierce → Flutterfall → Wind Unbound). Yol will forcefully retreat without using Wind Unbound if its HP is too low (at about 6% HP left).LootSee also:Nomad's Weapons,Nomad's ArmorandNomad's AccessoriesGarulaNameTypeItem

Mettle10Discover every location withinBardam's Mettle.-4.0ImagesLoreIn The Footsteps Of A LegendAlong the edges of the Azim Steppe, there wends a trail rife with danger said to have been blazed by a great hero of Xaela legend. Named Bardam's Mettle for the hero, braving it is a rite of passage for the youths of the Steppe.Completing the rite requires one to run a gauntlet of fearsome foes to reach an ancient altar, the oldest in the land, and thence tame a yol, a giant cloudkin. In so doing, one earns recognition as a warrior and is permitted to participate in the Naadam, the battle to decide the ruler of these vast fields.As observed in the memoir Narrow Road through the Deep Grass, the trail symbolizes Bardam’s life. A warrior of rare talent, the young Bardam was a boastful man, but his hubris brought him low and he found himself lying at death’s door. Yet the gods saw fit to spare him, and he was prompted to reflect upon his ways. Keeping the lesson of his bitter defeat ever close to heart, he rose again to become perhaps the greatest hero in Xaela history, carving his name into their annals by triumphing in the very first Naadam. Long after his time, Bardam the Brave continues to inspire new generations of aspiring warriors, who walk in his footsteps in hopes of emulating his legend.YolHigh atop the granite peaks of Othard’s Far East do the yol claim their demesne, descending to the Azim Steppe to prey upon the soft warriors who pretend not to fear the winged monsters of their ancestors' tales. Rare indeed is it that a yol might cede its back to the likes of man, though to those who have proved their mettle, the creatures have been known to make exception.BardamRepresenting a youthful Bardam, this stone colossus embodies his youthful strength and arrogance. By overcoming this trial, one comes to know the folly that Bardam himself committed; only then can one begin to walk the path of a true hero.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
