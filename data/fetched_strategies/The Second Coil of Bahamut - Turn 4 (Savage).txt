This activates as soon as the boss is pulled. Players will need to be careful to not get knocked into this as the fight progresses.
The fight has a 13 minute hard enrage, requiring players to defeat the boss before time runs out or the boss will wipe the party.Abilities:Ravensbeak: Tankbuster that inflictsRaven Blight. On expiry, explodes in a small AoE around the target and applies a 25s vuln stack, making a tank swap required.Raven Dive: Jumps to a player and performsIron Chariotbefore jumping back to the main target. Both jumps deal damage.Iron Chariot: Performed on a ranged player at random, deals damage and a knockback to anyone close by.Ravensclaw: Heavy-hitting frontal cleave.Thermionic Beam: A random player is marked, and the boss fires a laser at that player. Stack to mitigate damage.Lunar Dynamo: 20y donut AoE with lifesteal.Stardust: A random player is targeted with either a red or yellow marker over their head, and a meteor will drop shortly where they were standing. The meteors will persist where they drop and deal proximity-based damage. If a meteor is placed too close to another, it will explode, wiping the raid. If a player is still standing where the meteor lands, the player will die.Meteor Stream: 4 random players are targeted with markers over their heads. Clones will drop on marked players dealing high damage to any players hit as well as in a small AoE.Dalamud Dive: Hits the main target upon returning fromMeteor Stream, dealing high damage.Phase 1: 100% - 65%For the first phase, the boss will simply cycle through attacks. It is recommended Simply burn the boss down to 65% while dropping the meteors around the edge of the arena, keeping the red and yellow meteors close to one another without overlapping each other. Players will commonly drop the red meteors around the inner circle of the arena, near the three circles in the center of the arena, and the yellow meteors behind those past the second ring around the arena. Another common strategy is to drop the meteors around the arena at clock positions for the next phase. Players should also be careful to stand away from the tanks to avoid damage fromRaven Blightexploding once it resolves. Attack the boss and burn its HP to 65%, and it will surround itself with a barrier, becoming untargetable.Phase 2The boss will drop meteors on 3 players, and summon two sets of threeDalamud Spawnthat appear in three different colors:Red Dalamud Spawn:Earthen Heart: Deals high damage on all players hit by the AoE and drops a blue puddle on the ground. Players who stand in this puddle will receive aBurnsdamage-over-time debuff that deals 1000 damage per tick.Heavy Strike: Deals heavy damage in an AoE that staggers outward in waves. Players need to not be standing in the AoE by the time the marker fades.Green Dalamud Spawn:Demolish: Deals high raid-wide damage.Stone skull: A high-damage tankbuster.Boulder Clap: A cleave from the front of the ad's hitbox, deals high damage.Blue Dalamud Spawn:Magnetism: Pulls in any players, ads or comets with in a small radius.Earthshock: high raid-wide damage andParalysison all players. This attack must beInterrupted.Players will feed the meteors persisting on the field to the ads by bringing them near the comets. ADalamud Spawnshould only be fed three comets, or it will grow in size and wipe the raid. The red comets give aDamage Upbuff, and the yellow comets giveHaste. These buffs can stack. 
If these ads are brought too close to one another, they will tether, one will eat the other and grow large, gaining a massiveDamage UpandVulnerability Downbuff, making it impossible to kill and wiping the raid.
About a minute after the ads spawn, the phase repeats and needs to be handled the same way. 
Another minute after this, the boss will begin counting down before it castsMegaflare. This attack will deal high damage to the party and needs to be mitigated. If any comets remain on the field, they will explode and wipe the raid. If two or more golems still remain, they will fuse and wipe the raid. The arena will transform and the boss will leap away from the arena.Phase 3: 65% - 47%The boss will useDalamud Diveimmediately on the main tank, so they should move away from the rest of the party. Once the boss drops, it will then castHeavensfall, dropping a massive pillar into the center of the arena, dealing proximity damage. The pillar will kill players if they touch it. The pillar will slowly sink into the ground, firing conal AoEs outwards that reach the edge of the arena. Once the pillar is gone, the AoEs will stop. If a player is hit by the pillar crashing into the ground, they will die.
The boss will castHeavensfallperiodically, changing the patterns of the AoEs that fire.
The boss doesn't use eitherRavensbeakorRavensclawanymore, so players don't need to worry about overlapping damage or cleaving. However, the boss will gain some new abilities instead:Bahamut's Claw: Hits multiple times on the main target, dealing heavy damage.Garrote Twist: The boss fires a debuff at a random player that applies a stackingGarrotethat will kill the player if the stack reaches 9.Supernova: The boss fires this attack at two random players without any indicator. These will drop two large AoEs under where they were standing. These will deal small damage, however they will persist. Stepping into these will deal significant damage and inflict aHeavydebuff. The boss fires these during the secondHeavensfall.The boss will also summon aGhost of Meracydiaafter eachHeavensfall. The ad has abilities as well:Fire Breath: Drops fire puddles under a random player target. The puddles persist for a while and inflictBurns, dealing massive damage per tick.Tail Whip: A high-damage, single target attack.Binding Chain: at 50%, the ad will target two random players and tether to them and quickly adds stacks ofGarrote, requiring players to kill the ad to break the chains.When the ad dies it will also drop an AoE that will kill players caught in it. It will also drop three small lights on the arena that will dispel theGarrotedebuff.
After theHeavensfallattacks finish, the off tank will grab theGhost of Meracydiaand pull it near the other boss to allow for efficient AoE damage to burn down the ad while also attacking the boss. 
A common strategy is to wait until after the secondHeavensfallcompletes, then using a caster Limit Break level 3 to push the boss's HP to close to 47% and kill the second ghost ad. The phase will continue with the boss rotating through attacks until reaching the final phase.Phase 4: 47% - 0%The boss will castBahamut's Favor, buffing the boss with a stackingDamage Upbuff which will periodically be cast and add another stack throughout the phase.  The boss will also summon three dragons around the edge of the arena, one of fire, ice and lightning. Each dragon will periodically fire an attack at players which will apply a debuff:Chain Lightning: A random player is targeted and is dealt a small amount of damage and debuffs withThunderstruck. When this debuff resolves, it deals heavy damage to the player inflicted, as well as players close by in an AoE, and debuffs withParalysison anyone other than the originally debuffed player. This attack always firesFireball.Fireball: A random player is targeted and an AoE drops on them, and debuffs the player withScorched, which makes the nextFireballhit extremely hard. However, each player will be cycled through before hitting the same character again. The only way to remove this debuff is to be hit byIceball.Iceball:  A random player is targeted and an AoE drops on them, and debuffs the player withFrostbitten, which makes the nextIceballhit extremely hard. However, each player will be cycled through before hitting the same character again. The only way to remove this debuff is to be hit byFireball.The boss will also do a much stronger version ofBahamut's Clawthat deals significantly more damage. It will require a cooldown or a tankswap to survive.
The boss will start by castingBahamut's Claw, as the firstFireballtether comes out. Players can decide if they want to stand in or out of this, then the boss will useRavensdiveon a random ranged player and back to the main tank. At this time,Thunderstruckwill also fire at this time, debuffing a player with the debuff. The boss will then follow up withLunar Dynamoaround the same time the debuffed player'sThunderstruckdebuff explodes in its AoE. To handle this, the debuffed player will need to stand on one edge of the safe zone while the party stacks on the other.Nael Deus Darnuswill start a new combo withIron Chariot, while anotherFireballtether will come out. A player will be targeted by anotherThunderstruckand the boss will target a player withThermionic Beam. TheThunderstruckplayer should not stack to mitigate this attack. The boss will follow up by castingSupernovathree times on three random players. The party will have to spread out to bait theSupernovas, then move in to stack forThermionic Beam. Finally, anotherFireballwill come out at this time. The boss will use anotherBahamut's Claw. The dragons at the edge of the arena will then useDivebomb, where dragons will target a player and drop on them in an AoE. Two dragons will drop first, then the last dragon will drop shortly after. The order they drop in depends on where they spawn around the arena withBahamut's Favor. 
The first two dragons will drop here, the boss will castMeteor Stream, then the final dragon will useDivebomb, then the boss will cast anotherMeteor Streambefore following up withDalamud Diveon the main tank, which requires mitigation to survive.
The boss will cycle through these combos and abilities while the dragons fire their attacks at players. The recommendation is to have players stack inside theFireballon rotation, in and out to help mitigate theIceball. The boss will continue these rotations until 13 minutes has passed (or three rotations) and the boss enrages, slow-castingMegaflare. The boss needs to be defeated before then or the party will wipe.LootSee also:High Allagan WeaponsNael Deus Darnus20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsWhite Raven Armor FragmentTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityHigh Allagan Aetherstone - WeaponryMaterialN/AABasic1High Allagan Aetherstone - Body GearMaterialN/AABasic1High Allagan Chest Gear Coffer (IL 110)OtherN/AABasic1Faded Copy of Rise of the White RavenOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPaladin's High Allagan Arms (IL 115)OtherN/ACBlue1High Allagan BattleaxeMarauder's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan GuillotineDark Knight's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan SpearLancer's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan BaghnakhsPugilist's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan CleaversRogue's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Composite BowArcher's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan PistolMachinist's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan StaffTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Grimoire of CastingArcanist's Grimoire115CBlue1High Allagan CrookTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Grimoire of HealingScholar's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Star GlobeAstrologian's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Weapon Coffer (IL 115)OtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchScent of a Woman10DefeatNael deus Darnuswithin thefourth turnofthe Second Coil of Bahamut (Savage).Domitor (Male) / Domitrix (Female)2.3RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
