After the Calamity, however the location was abandoned - those remaining in the pens, left for dead. Not all of them, however, met that fate and now the tunnels are rife with those who survived... as well as the tormented spirits of those who did not.— In-game descriptionHalataliis a level 20dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.Contents1Objectives2Walkthrough3Bosses3.1Firemane3.2Thunderclap Guivre3.3Pit Peiste3.4Tangata4Bestiary5Loot5.1Firemane5.2Thunderclap Guivre5.3Tangata5.4Treasure Coffers5.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 14.3 Y: 9.9)5.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 12.7 Y: 9.0)5.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 12.0 Y: 9.5)5.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 11.6 Y: 7.4)5.4.5Treasure Coffer 5 (X: 10.4 Y: 8.6)5.4.6Treasure Coffer 6 (X: 9.5 Y: 8.9)5.4.7Treasure Coffer 7 (X: 11.8 Y: 8.5)5.4.8Treasure Coffer 8 (X: 8.7 Y: 11.2)6Achievements7Images8Lore8.1Given To The Beasts8.2Tangata8.3Adventurous Opposition8.4NarasimhaObjectivesClear the Hall of the Cesti : 0/1Activate the chain winch : 0/5Clear the Hall of the Secutores: 0/1DefeatTangata: 0/1WalkthroughFor the path, start by going south towards the Hall of the Cesti for the first boss. Use the Aetherial Flow to proceed to the next section.Pull the Chain Winches as all 5 will need to be pulled to gain access to the Hall of the Secutores. The fourth one will spawn a gas bomb that will self destruct and kill anyone standing in the AOE - simply stay out of the area and let it go off safely. As the 5th Winch is pulled the door should open. Go down into the pit, kill the boss, and use another Aetherial Flow.Most groups will simply turn right and go through the Ludus Door immediately, as it is not required to kill the Pit Peiste. This is where the final boss is located.BossesHalatali GuideFiremaneFiremane is a fire elemental that constantly summons wisps as adds. The wisps travel toward the fire pit in the center of the boss room. If they reach the pit, they will explode and deal damage to everyone in your party. Unlike the other bosses, Firemane will not go immune while the adds are spawning, so be sure to burst Firemane down or kill the wisps before they can reach the pit.Thunderclap GuivreThunderclap Guivre is a drake in a shallow pool of water. It can use Levinshower, a frontal AoE cone attack, and Electrify, a non-self-centered AoE attack which will make the water glow purple; any players standing in the water will takeElectrocutiondamage over time. Those in the water will take significantly more damage from the lightning attacks, so it is advised to fight on either of the slopes.During this boss fight, Thunderclap Guivre will walk back to the middle of the pool of water and become invulnerable two times, once at around 65% and once at around 30% HP. He spawns about 5 lightning elementals while invulnerable. They will cast lightning spells at the party. Kill the elementals and the drake will become vulnerable again, then repeat.Pit PeistePit Peiste is a reptilian optional boss with Rudius Beaks as adds. He is spawned when any player approaches the treasure chest at the open center of a stone circular area. It is not required to complete the dungeon and so is often skipped.TangataTangata, the giant ox-like creature, is the final boss of Halatali. He has a devastating frontal AoE cone attack. During the fight, Tangata will become invulnerable at around 80% and 60% and create a pool of lava surrounding himself. While invulnerable, he summons Fire Sprites at the open door (one at a time) and streams of wisps from the four torches. The focus is killing three Fire Sprites each phase, which will also be attacking your party members. Simply kill the Fire Sprites and Tangata will become vulnerable again. Wisps will travel toward Tangata and explode if they reach him, although this is typically a lower priority than the Fire Sprites. This will happen two times - simply repeat killing the Fire Sprites until he dies.BestiaryNameDropsColiseum PythonDamantusDoctoreFiremaneFire SpriteGas BombSelf-destructHeckler ImpNameDropsLightning SpriteNoxiusPit PeisteRudis BeakScythe MantisTangataThunderclap GuivreLootSee also:Doctore's Weapons,Doctore's ArmorandDoctore's AccessoriesFiremaneNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityCoeurl's EyeHead22BGreen1Doctore's BracersHands22BGreen1Doctore's Chain CoifHead22BGreen1Doctore's HatHead22BGreen1Doctore's RingbandsHands22BGreen1Doctore's VambracesHands22BGreen1Thunderclap GuivreNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityCoeurl's EyeHead22BGreen1Doctore's BracersHands22BGreen1Doctore's Chain CoifHead22BGreen1Doctore's ChainmailBody22BGreen1Doctore's HarnessBody22BGreen1Doctore's HatHead22BGreen1Doctore's RingbandsHands22BGreen1Doctore's RobeBody22BGreen1Doctore's SubligarLegs22BGreen1Doctore's TightsLegs22BGreen1Doctore's TrousersLegs22BGreen1Doctore's VambracesHands22BGreen1TangataNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAetherial Brass Ear CuffsEarrings20DAetherial1Aetherial Coral ArmillaeBracelets19DAetherial1Aetherial Coral RingRing19DAetherial1Doctore's Armored BowArcher's Arm22BGreen1Doctore's BillMarauder's Arm22BGreen1Doctore's BucklerShield22BGreen1Doctore's CrookTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm22BGreen1Doctore's CudgelOne-handed Thaumaturge's Arm22BGreen1Doctore's ForkLancer's Arm22BGreen1Doctore's GrimoireArcanist's Grimoire22BGreen1Doctore's HoraPugilist's Arm22BGreen1Doctore's ScimitarGladiator's Arm22BGreen1Doctore's StilettosRogue's Arm22BGreen1The Ludus Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Treasure CoffersNot every chest appears on every run.

In the chaos that followed the Calamity, however, the facility was abandoned and the creatures were left to starve. Five years later, in a bid to resume operations, a team of builders was sent in to survey the premises. But instead of carcasses littering the floors, they found feral beasts prowling the halls, grown unnaturally strong and savage through a ruthless struggle for survival.Fearless adventurers were called in to eliminate the creatures, and following extensive renovations, Halatali was declared fit for purpose once more. Reporting on its restoration, Ul’dah’s leading paper, the Mythril Eye, hailed Halatali as one of the great post-Calamity revival stories.TangataWhile the sultanate ordinarily prohibits the commercial use of voidsent, a generous donation made to the Order of Nald’thal secured an exception for this ogre, which was put to fighting in the Coliseum. It must be noted, however, that the specimen was captured in its natural habitat in Coerthas and not summoned via forbidden magicks.Adventurous OppositionWith the danger purged and renovations completed, Halatali’s doors were thrown open for the first time since the Calamity, its halls echoing, once more with the familiar clang of steel and the roar of beasts. Seeking to further hone its gladiators' sword arms, the Coliseum Foundation reached out to adventurers for sterner opposition, full many of whom eagerly answered the call, taking to the field in mock battles. Throwing its doors open wider, Halatali later came to host spectacles for the public, most notably the final bout of the prestigious Mythril Cup.NarasimhaA fearsome manticore commanded by Mumuepo, the disgraced former high priest of the Order of Nald’thal, who took to the bloodsands in order to make bail on corruption charges. No coin is spared in ensuring the battle-fitness and ferocity of this main attraction. To bind such a vicious creature to his will, the thaumaturge is said to have employed an ancient
art of enthrallment whose secrets he parsed from an old Belah'dian tome.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
