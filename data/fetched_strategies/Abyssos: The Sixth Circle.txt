However, Themis and Erichthonios succeed in convincing the chief keyward to allow you a chance to prove the worth of another way. You are tasked with interring Hegemone, the keyward of Abyssos and a master of creation magicks in her own right. Succeed in this, and you may continue your journey into the facility's deeper circles. Fail, and Pandæmonium─along with its warders and creations─shall be reduced to nothing.— In-game descriptionAbyssos: The Sixth Circleis a level 90raidintroduced inpatch 6.2withEndwalker.

Also note that failing any mechanic will debuff with a stackingVulnerability Up.AbilitiesAetheric Polyominoid: Calls down four needles around the arena that land at the inner corner of the outermost intercardinal tiles, creating either a danger zone or a safe zone at each tile it touches. Step out of the pulsating tile to avoid.Choros Ixou: The boss moves to the center and points her hands at either the east and west, or north and south of the arena, and fires a conal AoE that takes up roughly a quarter of the arena in those directions. Move away from the direction the boss's hands are pointing to avoid.Hemitheos's Dark IV: Unavoidable room wide AoE.Transmission: The boss tethers to players, and they will be infected with aGlossomorphdebuff. At the resolution of the debuff, players will be frozen in place and fire a conal AoE that reaches across the arena, dealing high damage and debuffing with aVulnerability Upstack.Synergy: A tankbuster that targets both tanks. Inflicts a light 15 secondBleeddebuff. Any other player hit by the AoE will die.Strophe Ixou: The boss will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise in accordance with the arrows that appear, and fire conal AoEs in front of and behind her hitbox until she has completed a full 360 degree rotation.Dark Ashes: An AoE will appear under each player, then deal damage shortly after. Separate to avoid overlapping damage.Aetherial Exchange: The nextAetheric Polyominoidwill becomePolyominoid Sigma, and will tether in pairs and switch locations before the cast fires. Some of thePolyominoidswill have no safe zone.StrategyThe boss starts withAetheric Polyominoid, creating various safe and danger zones on the floor. Players simply need to move to a tile that is not pulsating to avoid. The boss will then return to the center of the arena, and castChoros Ixouthree times. To avoid, players must watch which direction the boss points her hands, and move away from that direction.At roughly 80% health, the boss will tether to a tank, healer and two DPS and castTransmission, inflicting the debuffGlossomorph. She will then tether to the other tank, healer and DPS. When the debuff reaches five seconds, a large timer will appear over the infected players head, indicating the end of the debuff. When the timer finishes, players will be frozen in place by the debuffOut of Control, then fire a conal AoE in the direction they are facing. If hit by this, players will take high damage and aSustained Damagedebuff.  To handle this, players should turn towards the outside of the arena before the timer reaches zero so their attack will fire harmlessly over the edge of the arena.After all the debuffs have resolved, the boss will castSynergy, targeting both tanks (or the two highest in the enmity list if a tank is dead) and dealing high damage and inflicting a lightBleeddebuff in a small AoE around each target. If any player other than the tanks are hit by this, they will die. The boss will follow this up with anotherAetheric Polyominoidpaired with aChoros Ixou, so players should be prepared to move to a safe zone, and close to the boss to mitigate taking overlapping damage.The boss will then useStrophe Ixou, so players will need to watch which direction the arrows are pointing and rotate around the boss to avoid getting hit. After this the boss will return to the center of the arena if she's been moved and cast anotherTransmission, tethering to all players this time. Players will get either a ten second or twenty second debuff, but it is still handled the same way as before. The boss will also fire aChoros Ixou, so players should be sure not to get hit by this when positioning for the debuff timer. Before the second set of debuffs fire, the boss will also castDark Ashes, placing an AoE under each player, requiring them to spread out to avoid overlapping damage. Players with debuffs should still face away from the center of the arena. The boss will follow up with anotherSynergy.After the boss reaches 50% health or below, she will begin to useAetherial Exchange, causing theAetheric Polyominoidto becomePolyominoid Sigma. When thePolyominoidsappear, they will tether in pairs, and then swap positions just before the cast finishes, moving the safe locations. Players need to be aware of where the new safe areas will be after the swap, as some will not have a safe zone at all. Players should stand on the tile where the safe zone will appear after the cast finishes to avoid damage. The boss will cast this twice, then move to the center of the arena and useHemitheos's Dark IV.From here the boss will repeat her moveset starting with theAetherial Exchange/Polyominoid Sigma/Strophe Ixoucombination until she is defeated.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityUnsung Helm of AbyssosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Armor of AbyssosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Ring of AbyssosOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityUnsung Gauntlets of AbyssosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Chausses of AbyssosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Greaves of AbyssosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Ring of AbyssosOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 3NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityScream Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1DialogueHegemone: Abyssos is my charge, and I shall not shirk my duty!
