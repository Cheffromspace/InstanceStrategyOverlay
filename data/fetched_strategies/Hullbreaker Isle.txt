Hidden within this impenetrable shroud is Hullbreaker Isle, so named for having smashed innumerable hapless vessels into flotsam over the centuries. In the wake of the Calamity, however, it came to be that the mist would lift under certain conditions. On one such day, a merchantman sailed into the area to behold not only the isle itself, but also the wreck of theHaar, the flagship of the dread pirate Mistbeard. The discovery has rekindled interest in Mistbeard's legendary hoard, and treasure hunters the realm over are now scrambling to find passage to the elusive isle.— In-game descriptionHullbreaker Isleis a level 50dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.3.Contents1Objectives2Enemies3Bosses3.1Sasquatch3.1.1Abilities3.2Sjoorm3.2.1Abilities3.3Kraken3.3.1Abilities4Loot4.1Sasquatch4.2Sjoorm4.3Kraken4.4Other Loot4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 15.4 Y: 8.3)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 15.4 Y: 8.3)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 15.5 Y: 8.3)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 5.3 Y: 10.3)5Achievements6Images6.1Gear Images6.2Dungeon Images7Lore7.1Mistbeard's Treasure7.2The Kraken7.3A New Legend7.4Grand Storm Marshal Eynaahr Slafyrsyn8TriviaObjectivesDefeat thesifakas: 0/5Slay thesasquatch: 0/1Find the stone tablets: 0/3SlaySjoorm: 0/1Navigate the geysers: 0/2Dismember the arms and tentacles: 0/10EnemiesSifakaCieldalaes HornetCieldalaes MantisHarpeiaSmallfoot SifakaZuzecaTreasure CofferNinki NankaNankaSallet CrabCieldalaes CrawlerSeawater SpriteCyclomedusaBossesHullbreaker Isle GuideSasquatchKill adds then the boss. Every now and then Sasquatch will get hungry and repeatedly pound his chest. When this occurs, players should activate one of the banana trees and allow the boss to eat the banana dropped from the tree. The bananas calm him down, stopping his debuffs and AoE attacks for a while. Throughout the fight, monkey adds will spawn. Kill these adds and do not let them eat the bananas.When the boss pounds his chest, activate the Bananas Tree and spawn banana. Do not let the adds go near the spawned bananas.AbilitiesWild Banana Tree: There are 6 banana trees along the edges of the arena. Interacting with the tree drops aBanana Bunchon the ground.

Occasionally bubbles will spawn, do not run into or contact the bubbles until the boss submerges underground for the second time and starts to cast a blue AoE wave that covers the entire boss room. By running into the bubbles, the players will be shielded from the boss' AoE damage. Players outside of the bubbles will take massive amount of damage.Use the bubbles to avoid the boss' room-wide AoE. Otherwise do not touch the bubbles.AbilitiesUpwell: Long frontal line AoE.Water Puddle: Targets each player with a large AoE. After a few seconds, it will deal moderate damage to any player standing in the AoE.Watery Grave:  	Large bubbles that spawn around the room in a 3x3 grid. Used to avoidWhirlpool. Imobilizes and deals slight damage to players while inside, and deals additional damage in an arena-wide AoE when the bubbles pop.Burrow: The boss will become untargetable and dive into the earth. Uses eitherWhirlpoolorTunnel.Whirlpool: A large, pulsing AoE will appear in the center of the room. Players need to step intoWatery Gravebubbles to avoid the damage. Standing too soon or too late will cause the player to take moderate damage and be sucked into the middle of the room, where they will be hit a second time as the boss emerges.Tunnel: The boss will move across the room in the direction of a random player, dealing damage in the form of small AoEs above it.Surface Breach: Used when the boss returns fromBurrow. Deals heavy damage.Avoid standing where aWatery Gravecan spawn, as it will suck you in if you're nearby.TunnelandWhirlpoolalternate every otherBurrow.KrakenIn the Kraken fight, players will kill 10 of its arms, two per platform. The boss room is divided into various platforms. Players need to use the water sprouts around the platforms to move to among them. Every now and then players will get a green pulsating icon over their heads. This indicates that a tornado is about to spawn on top of you. The player with the green icon should move to another platform immediately, then move back to the previous platform when the tornado drops, because the tornadoes act as time bombs. They will do enormous amounts of damage after a short time. Note that every time you jump you get a stacking debuff that increases the damage you will take.When a green icon appears over a players head, said player need to jump to a different platform, wait for the tornado to drop, then jump back.AbilitiesPlatforms: There are 4 platforms in the arena that players can useWaterspoutsto get to.Waterspouts: Used to move betweenPlatforms. Applies a 15-second stacking Suppuration debuff when used; avoid excessive/repeated use in a short time to keep the debuff down.Kraken's Arm: One is spawned on eachPlatform. Killing one spawns a second at the same platform that needs to be killed as well.Wallop: frontal cone AoE.Inkblot: A large AoE on a random player. Applies a slow debuff and a DoT.Clearout: Donut AoE.

Should be focused over theArmas it has more health and is more annoying.Wallop: frontal cone AoE.Scoop: Will pick up players, immobilizing them, and throw them onto random platforms.World's End: Marks 1-2 players with a large green meteor icon. After a few seconds, they will drop a tornado where they are standing. A few more seconds after that, the tornado will explode, dealing heavy damage to all players in a massive AoE around it. Marked players should bring the marker to another island and drop it along the far edge and return, with the rest of the group moving against the far wall on the platform they stayed on.World's Endtornado AoEs are big enough to hit across platforms if not dropped along the edge of the room, so keep an eye out.TheTentaclewill follow the tank to whicheverPlatformthey are on, making it annoying to attack if the tank is jumping around a lot. Try to stay in one place if not dodging aWorld's End.LootSee also:Ilvl 80 Dungeon ArmorandIlvl 80 Dungeon AccessoriesSasquatch10Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBoots of the

Isle.-2.3ImagesGear ImagesDungeon ImagesLoreMistbeard's TreasureUpon the Rhhotano Sea, along the fringes of the Cieldalae, there lies Hullbreaker Isle. Shrouded in the perpetual mist of the Doxy’s Pull, its jagged reefs have spelled the end of many a ship, and the place has long been given a wide berth by sailors. These selfsame hazards, however, served to attract the pirate king Mistbeard, who availed himself of the isle for his hideout.Last seen two and twenty summers prior, the pirate left behind a legacy rife with rumors—not the least of all those pertaining to his accumulated plunder. Believing that his fabulous cache still lay somewhere out there, waiting to be claimed, no few pirating crews feverishly devoted themselves to the hunt, but the years yielded not so much as a single coin, and gradually the fever passed.Recently, however, the fires of desire were rekindled when, on a rare mistless day, a merchant vessel inadvertently sailed into the area to find not only the isle, but the wreck of the Haar, Mistbeard’s flagship. Thus did the race begin anew, with treasure hunters the realm over scrambling to be the first to reach the elusive isle and lay their hands upon the pirate king's cache.The KrakenThis monster of the deep long terrorized the high seas sending countless ships to watery grave, until it met its match some decades ago in the Haar, Mistbeard’s flagship. Beaten and subdued, it submitted to the pirate’ authority and came to guard the secret cove at Hullbreaker Isle.A New LegendTo the chagrin of countless treasure hunters, the golden coffer of the legendary Mistbeard was not to be found on Hullbreaker Isle. And so like the mists which had withdrawn to reveal the isle did those ambitious souls depart to seek fame and fortune elsewhere, allowing Eymaahr Slafyrsyn to quietly petition Admiral Merlwyb for permission to repurpose it as a training, ground for Maelstrom recruits.For the first to brave this gauntlet of the isle’s fearsome fauna and the Maelstrom’s elite, the storm marshal sought out the vaunted Warrior of Light. But events took an unexpected turn, for word of the hero’s participation soon reached the ears of Limsa Lominsa’s hardest men and women, and the likes of Carvallain of the Kraken’s Arms and Rhoswen of the Sanguine Sirens flocked to the isle in hopes of winning a famous victory over the champion in battle against the Warrior of Light. So it was that the cast and crew were assembled and the curtains rose upon a new legend of Hullbreaker Isle.Grand Storm Marshal Eynaahr SlafyrsynEynaahr serves as the Maelstrom’s second-in-command and presides over the daily affairs of its headquarters—a mundane life for the one he once led as the infamous pirate king Mistbeard some decades ago. For but a moment he relived those days, donning the mask of his former persona in battle against the Warrior of light.TriviaThe name Sjoorm comes from the Swedish wordSjöormor Norwegian wordSjøorm(Translation: Sjö/Sjø = Sea, Orm = Serpent).
