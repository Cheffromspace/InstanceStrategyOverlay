Subsequent parties beware.— Water-stained NoteOn The Sylph Elder's TrailIn the past this forbidding dungeon held all of Gridania’s foulest criminals, from arsonists to poachers. Its name is taken from a man-eating creature of legend, perhaps by way of a brutal warden who wore the selfsame epithet.Declared barbaric by the Elder Seedseer some thirty years ago, Toto-Rak was abandoned and subsequently became a hive for fiends. It was into this perilous place that the sylph elder, Frixio, inadvertently wandered as he fled from imperial soldiers, prompting the Scions of the Seventh Dawn to mount a rescue. Within the dank and gloomy depths, the adventurer sent to find the sylph encountered one of the Ascians, the servants of Darkness, who in no uncertain terms made known the threat they posed.Coeurl o' Nine TailsThe name of this enormous ochu is a morbid reference to the cruel whips the dungeon's gaolers once employed. Made by binding together several sinewy vines, a single stroke can inflict excruciating pain evoked by the seedkn’s overgrown vines.GraffiasAlready fattened from an abundance of prey within Toto-Rak, this banemite gained further girth and unnatural ferocity through the Ascian Lahabrea’s dark powers. In the wake of this incident, the Order of the Twin Adder conducted a thorough sweep of the dungeon, destroying all of the vilekin to the last egg.MoreMites reportedly infested the dungeon’s inner sector, which was slick with their vile secretions and grimly adorned with their prey, tightly bound and preserved for later consumption.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
