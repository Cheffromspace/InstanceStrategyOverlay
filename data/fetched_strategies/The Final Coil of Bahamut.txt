The Final Coil of Bahamut was released inpatch 2.4, and requires players with item level of 123 or higher to enter. Once unlocked, the raidcanbe queued from theDuty Finder.Note: Because the Coils of Bahamut have a difficulty somewhere between (Extreme) and (Savage), these raids are not included in anyroulette(evenMentor). As such, players queuing viaDuty Finderwill almost never be able to form a party.That being the case, it is recommended that newer players use theParty Finderto seek the assistance of a couple of level-capped players for a "unsync run" using theUnrestricted Partyoption. This will allow players to see the story at an appropriate point in theirMain Scenario Questprogression. They can also easily solo the raids with a level 80+ character.Contents1General Information2Unlock3Floors4Rewards4.1Gear4.1.1Weapons4.1.2Armor4.1.3Accessories5Images5.1Gear Images5.2Raid ImagesUnlockPlayers must first complete all of theBahamut Questsup throughAlisaie's Resolve.
