It is used up to seven times in a row depending on Titan's current HP.Geocrushis a leaping AoE attack. When Titan jumps into the air, a giant, red, circular ground indicator will appear at the perimeter of the boss room. After a few seconds, Titan slams down into the center of the room, dealing damage to all players based on how close you are to the center. The ability also breaks off the perimeter of the boss platform. Players at the edge of the boss room will take moderate damage, whereas players close to the center will take heavy damage.Weight of the Landis an AoE ability that spawns circular pools of sand under four random players. The swirls explode after a few seconds and deal heavy damage to all targets hit.Bomb Bouldersis an ability that spawns numerous bombs around the boss room that will eventually explode in the order they dropped, dealing heavy damage to nearby players.Rock Throwis an ability that spawns a clock-like symbol underneath a random player. After a few seconds, the marked player will be encased within aGranite Gaol. Any player trapped in this manner cannot move, attack, or use any abilities. However, other players can attack the Gaol to break the player free. After escaping a Gaol, the victim will have a cleansableDamage Downdebuff.Earthen Furyis Titan's ultimate ability. If Titan's Heart has not been destroyed before the end of the phase, Titan will instantly kill all players. However, if the heart is destroyed in time, Titan will do a moderate amount of damage to all players instead.Mountain Busteris a frontal attack that deals heavy damage to Titan's target.RotationsPhase 1:Landslide -> Tumult -> (Repeat)Phase 2:Weight of the Land -> Landslide -> Tumult -> (Repeat)Phase 3:Landslide -> Weight of the Land -> Bomb Boulders -> Landslide -> Weight of the Land -> Rock Throw -> Tumult -> (Repeat)Phase 4:Rock Throw -> Landslide -> Weight of the Land -> Tumult -> Rock Throw -> Landslide -> Weight of the Land -> Earthen FuryPhase 5:Mountain Buster -> Tumult -> Weight of the Land -> Bomb Boulders + Landslide -> Mountain Buster -> Weight of the Land -> Rock Throw -> Landslide -> (Repeat)Tips1. You can instant-die if you get pushed off the ledge. The attack "Landslide" is a line AOE targeting a random party member. If you get hit by this you will be knocked off the stage, so prioritize dodging it over trying to tank the damage.2. During "Geocrush" (boss jumps up in the air, disappears, then slams the ground) there is no knockback when he lands. However, the arena past the red line is destroyed. Therefore, stay inside the red circle (so you don't fall off), but stand just in front of the line to take less damage.3. When the rock boulders spawn they will become targetable. Level-synced, destroying them is impossible. Watch the order they appear in to know which order they will explode, and dodge them.4. Falling off used to be a perma-death, but in the current patch you can now be resurrected.LootSee also:Crag Weapons15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsTitan Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)Titan's HeartDrops directly from boss, must besyncedTreasure CofferNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityThe Axe of CragsMarauder's Arm80CBlue1Guillotine of CragsDark Knight's Arm80CBlue1The Spear of CragsLancer's Arm80CBlue1Fists of CragsPugilist's Arm80CBlue1Katana of CragsSamurai's Arm80CBlue1Cleavers of CragsRogue's Arm80CBlue1The Bow of CragsArcher's Arm80CBlue1Culverin of CragsMachinist's Arm80CBlue1Staff of CragsTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm80CBlue1The Greater Key of TitanArcanist's Grimoire80CBlue1Foil of CragsRed Mage's Arm80CBlue1The Cane of CragsTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm80CBlue1The Holy Key of TitanScholar's Arm80CBlue1Star Globe of CragsAstrologian's Arm80CBlue1The Wall of CragsShield80CBlue1Crag Weapon Coffer (IL 80)OtherN/AABasic1ImagesDialogueTitan:Sons of man!
