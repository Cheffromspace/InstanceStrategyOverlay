Yet all thoughts of peace have been put to the blade, as a band of Mamool Ja mercenaries known as the Silverscales have stormed the walls and seized the place for their own. Someone must stop the sellswords from turning the Wanderer's Palace into an unassailable fortress, and take a stand against tonberry slaughter and slavery!— In-game descriptionThe Wanderer's Palace (Hard)is a level 50dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.5.Contents1Objectives2Enemies3Bosses3.1Frumious Koheel Ja3.2Slithy Zolool Ja3.3Manxome Molaa Ja Ja4Loot4.1Frumious Koheel Ja4.2Slithy Zolool Ja4.3Manxome Molaa Ja Ja4.4Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X:14.7 Y:18.9)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X:11.7 Y:8.1)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X:13.1 Y:4.5)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X:15.0 Y:4.7)5Achievements6Images6.1Gear Images6.2Dungeon Images7DialogueObjectivesSave the fleeing tonberries: 0/3DefeatFrumious Koheel Ja: 0/1Breach the defensive line: 0/1DefeatSlithy Zolool Ja: 0/1Free the imprisoned tonberries: 0/2Clear the Bellows: 0/1DefeatManxome Molaa Ja Ja: 0/1EnemiesSilverscales WarderPack ZizBronze PugilPteroc PointerSilverscales LurkerSacred SpearSilverscales StablerSacred StandardSilverscales SophistCombat WivrePurulent AbscessPurulent PustuleBavaroid WasteWivre FodderSilverscales ZenistSacred IdolBossesNote: Despite the (Hard) in the name, the dungeon is not actually more difficult than any other story-mode dungeon.

Frumious Koheel Ja castsFire Angonby throwing burning spears at the ground which cast a stacking debuff to the whole party if they are left alive.Slithy Zolool JaA shaman boss, who summons totems. If after a while no-one has claimed the totems, he will recall all of them and gain the buffs himself. Some of the totems grant buffs while some should be ignored. He will randomly hex a target and turns them into a toad for 12 seconds. He will also randomly cast Fire to the party members and while the damage is not too big, the totems can increase the damage.Standing in a totem gives you a buff or debuff. Clean as many of the flags as possible and don't stack fire resist down.There will be Purple, Red, Blue and Green Totems. The effects of the various colors are random. One will give you attack up (DPS should pick it up), another will give you the toad debuff or cleanse the toad debuff (only pick it up if you are a toad), another will give you fire resist down and final one will give the playerHeavydebuff.Because the Totem effects are random, use the first couple Totems to figure out which color has which effect. Do not allow any one player to have too many stacks of the fire debuff or the player will die when the boss casts a random fire spell on them.Manxome Molaa Ja JaStay very close to him to avoid a huge cone AoE. Move away for rotting gas. Person with rotting lung has to stay away from the party whenRotting Gaspops. The person with the lungs will also AoE around them.The boss drops multiple banners on the ground during the fight. The banners' buff the boss' damage and armor, so the tank should just pull the boss away from the banner-range. Tank needs to keep moving the boss so the party doesn't have to fight in the banner AoE.Do not allow the boss to stand in purple circle ofSacred Standard, by kiting him around the outer edge of the boss room.He will cast debuffs that makes healing worse andSoul Douse, which appliesDoomon random party members looking at him. Healers can remove doom by healing the target to full hp.WhenSacred Idolspawns (the Idol with a tether to the boss), kill it ASAP!LootSee also:Ilvl100 Dungeon ArmorandIlvl100 Dungeon
