ImportantThe North American and European data centers primarily useParty Finderto challenge (Extreme) content. Using Duty Finder to match with random players is not recommended and will be more difficult than pre-forming a party. For an easy completion (that will satisfy any quest requirements) or loot farming, it is recommended that players use Party Finder and form anUnrestricted Party(i.e., with level sync disabled). Players who wish to complete this duty with level sync enabled should also form a pre-made party, which also enables the use ofMinimum Item LevelandSilence Echosettings for a more authentic challenge compared to a Duty Finder party.This article is about the level 60 challenge-modetrial.

Does high damage, which will always crit, on its target and gainDamage Upbuff every 10 sec.Execrated Thew = Small add. Should also be tanked by a tank. Nothing special.Execrated Wile = doesn't need to be tanked. Should face away from it when Meracydian Fear is cast.Execrated Wit = Doesn't need to be tanked. Should kill it before Meracydian Meteor casting is done.Will x1 (North) + Thew (North): just AoE downWill x2 (West) + Wile x1 (South) + Wit x1 (East): Each tank grab 1 Will at West.

Should face away from North to avoid as well. Bring all the adds to North and AoE them down once Wit is dead.Zurvan's UltPhase 4 Part 1Tethers appear: 2 pairs of Infinite Fire and 2 pairs of Infinite Ice come out. Tethered pair should be close enough to each other to avoid DoT damage (about 10k dmg each tick). (similar to T11 tethers)Wave Cannon: Randomly selects a non-MT player and does damage withBleedingdebuff. Everyone else should be away from its target, but make sure target's partner is in safe distance of tether.Tyrfing: Attacks Main Tank 5 times with spear and does fire damage at the end. High damage and cooldowns are needed as necessary.Southern Cross: Stack under the boss and move out. Make sure tethered partner is going to the same direction or it's going to kill both players. Call out where you're going to!Broken Seal: Spawns 4 fire meteors and 4 ice meteors. 4 players with Infinite Ice go into 4 Ice meteor circles while 4 Infinite Fire goes into 4 Fire meteor circles. (Match your color) Since players are tethered, tethered pair should always be close to each other. Call out! There are three patterns that randomly spawn: please check here.Biting Halberd/Ciclicle/Tail End:IF blue/red circles at EDGE: Ciclicle(IN)IF blue/red circles at CENTER: Tail End(OUT)IF DIAMOND shapes x2: Biting Halberd(Butt)<basically repeating again from here>New tethers appear: find a new partner and hug each other.Wave Cannon: targets a random non-MT player.

OTProvokesthe boss off MT. MT will also get knocked back. Make sure position yourself at the center so MT doesn't get knocked back into the fiery wall.Wave Cannon: targets MT (not sure if it targets OT if theyProvokeduring Demon's claw or MT still gets targeted by it) and shows huge AoE box that arrows indicate into the AoE. Seems like people stack in the box to soak the damage together. However, my group just killed MT and had OTProvokeingthe boss after.<basically repeating again from here>New tethers appear: find a new partnerWave Cannon: targets a random non-MT player. Away from its target.Tyrfing(hits 7 times and fire damage)Southern CrossBroken Seal<repeating ends here>Biting HalberdThe Demon's ClawWave CannonNew tethers appearWave Cannon... Probably repeating... You wanna kill the boss now.Flame Halberd: Hard enrage castMechanicsSoarWhen Boss casts Soar, he shows 3 rectangle AoE's toward the edge of the arena. After Rectangle AoE, the boss disappears and spawn 3 mirages at the edge where the three rectangle AoE were targeting at. Then, 6 red unavoidable circle AoE(size of shadowflare or a little bit bigger) spawn on 6 randomly selected players. When 6 AoE's explode, three Divebombs of mirages happen at the same time, so should be away from mirage's divebomb range AND avoid clipping each other with red AoE circle. After the damage, one random player is targeted with a Stacking AoE marker(Thordan's Dragon's Rage AoE with 4 arrows indicating inside) while a random healer is targeted with a small red marker. Most of players should get into the Stacking AoE to soak the damage together, and the healer with a small red marker should be away from anyone around to avoid additional damage.Save LB3 for healer LB so your healer can always raise everyone after the mechanic. If no death or a few deaths, Melee LB after the mechanic.Divebomb Damage does a lot more damage than red Circle AoE AND also leavesVulnerability Updebuff to a player who gets hit. If there's no choice, I think clipping AoE is better than getting hit by mirage's divebombs.Just TANK LB during Soar helps a lot! (for soar in the last phase)Zurvan never Targets HEALERS with red AoE circles. IT means, it always targets 2 tanks and 4 DPS. Because of this, It's safe for healers to stack with any other players for this mechanic.BUT, If a DPS or Tank is dead, a healer will be marked with the red AoE circle. likewise, if a healer dies, a dps will be marked with a small red marker, and therefore should not be in the stacking marker with the group. Check if you have the small red marker if a healer dies, as failing to notice it will usually result in a wipe.Broken Sealcheck this out for 3 different patterns:If there are more than 2 deaths before this mechanic, expect a wipeCommunication is KEY. Say where you're going to!After Southern Cross, position yourself either Right Flank or Left Flank of the boss. Have 1 red and 1 blue pairs on each side so you can simply go to the closest meteor circles. But Still, Calling out is the best strat.IF blue/red circles at EDGE: followed by Ciclicle(IN)IF blue/red circles at CENTER: followed by Tail End(OUT)IF DIAMOND shapes x2: followed by Biting Halberd(Butt) -> Remember you CAN just walk through the boss.Demon ClawAfter Soar ends(in final phase part II), MT pulls the boss to the edge, and get knocked back to the other side.All other players get into the ranged AoE to save their MT.IF there's DARK KNIGHT, pull the boss to the edge of the arena and pop Living Dead right before Demon Claw and You'll be knocked back to the opposite side of arena. After a few seconds, Boss will target MT with Wave Cannon. Everyone stay away from it and Dark Knight will be killed and gain Walking Dead Status. Heal Dark Knight as necessary and everything's done!PLD'sHallowed Ground also works just like Dark Knight's LD. Time it correctly; use it right before demon claw casting is done. Make sure you are not knocked back into the dirty wall or it's still going to kill you.Hugging Wall still kills you even in hallowed ground/holmgang/walking dead status.StrategySouthern CrossStack at the butt.MT moves to the RIGHT(counter-clockwise), or just walk across the boss to be less risky with tether.Party moves to the LEFT(clockwise)If you're tethered with MT, move RIGHT(180 degree, so you don't get hit by tank cleaves)Wave CannonGo to LEFT/RIGHT FLANK of the boss (assign one)Rest of party can have RIGHT/LEFT Flank(opposite flank of wave cannon) and Rear.Broken Seal1 Red + 1 Blue on each Flank of the boss. Position yourself once Ice puddles disappear.Never stay close to the other pair of same colored tethers.If there's no matching circles on your side, go to opposite side of the other same-color tethered pair.SoarStrat 1:MT North, OT South, 2 DPS East, 2 DPS West, Healers stack with any tank/DPSLook out which pattern of soar (you have bunch of time to look out. memorize where soar AoEs are at)IF Evenly spread, there are 6 safe spots. go to the closest flank of a mirageIF 2 Mirages together, there are 2 large safe spots. position yourself not to clip each other with red AoE.Strat 2:Just Tank LB this shit before mechanic or Healer LB3 after mechanic.You may get clipped by NO MORE THAN TWO AoE's. Just AVOID the DivebombsLootSee also:Zurvanite WeaponsEach player will receive 1Demon Totemper kill.
