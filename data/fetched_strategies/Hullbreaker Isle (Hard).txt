And so like the mists which had withdrawn to reveal the isle did those ambitious souls depart to seek fame and fortune elsewhere, allowing Eynzhar Slafyrsyn to quietly petition Admiral Merlwyb for permission to repurpose it as a training ground for Maelstrom recruits.The storm marshal would have you be the first to brave this gauntlet, that you might pit yourself against the isle's fearsome fauna and the Maelstrom's elite, and in so doing rouse their spirits. Will you give the storm officers a beating they will not soon forget, or will they stand triumphant at the last and shout that they have bested the Warrior of Light?— In-game descriptionHullbreaker Isle (Hard)is a level 60dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.3withHeavensward.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Battle Coeurl, Sanguine Sirens Gunner, Sanguine Sirens Lodeswoman, Sanguine Sirens Targirl2.2Ymir2.3Grand Storm Marshal Slafyrsyn and Mistbeard3Loot3.1Battle Coeurl3.2Ymir3.3Grand Storm Marshal Slafyrsyn and Mistbeard3.4Additional Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 12.4 Y: 11.2)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 10.5 Y: 8.6)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 7.2 Y: 10.2)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 5.2 Y: 11.2)4Achievements5Images5.1Gear Images5.2Dungeon Images6Dialogue6.1Duty DialogueObjectivesClear the Hell of Howls: 0/1Defeat theSanguine Sirens: 0/1Clear the Hell of Malms: 0/1DefeatYmir: 0/1Clear the Hell of Waves: 0/1DefeatEynzahr: 0/1BossesHullbreaker Isle (Hard) by MizzteqBattle Coeurl,Sanguine Sirens Gunner,Sanguine Sirens Lodeswoman,Sanguine Sirens TargirlThis fight is very straightforward and is presented as several waves of fights. Primarily you'll need to dodge the AOEs, which include lines from the mobs and circles from offshore cannons. However, starting in the second wave and continuing into further waves, a coeurl will spawn tethered to the healer. This needs to be killed quickly as it applies a healing down debuff to the healer and a damage up buff to itself.YmirIn this fight you'll be dealing with a snail. This boss has a few major mechanics.A lightning tether. Move away to break the tetherSlime spots. These will cause you to become fettered for a time. However, they are useful because...Targeted lightning. You will be marked with a red flag. If this happens, move into the slime to become fettered and also immune to the lightning.Freezing. You will be marked with an ice flag and a circle. Try to place all of the circles close to each other without overlapping because after an initial freezing attack, an exploding ice block will be left behind. If these are not close to each other there may not be a safe spot.Grand Storm Marshal SlafyrsynandMistbeardThis boss has two forms. In the first form, simply tank him away from the rest of the party, dodge the AOEs, and heal through his arena wide damage. His second form is more complex and again has a few possible mechanics.Chests. Several chests will spawn and he willPoisoneveryone. Some of the chests will have a potion in them. Make sure each player gets to a chest with a potion to remove the poison.Target marker. A player can become marked. That player will be affected by a severeHeavybefore the boss targets them with a high damage AOE. The heavy needs to be removed ASAP so the player can dodge the AOE. This timing isverytight if you fail to notice the target icon, so if the person cannot escape, heal them to full so they can soak the damage.Firesand Kegs. The boss will throw these around the arena and then begin targeting them. After a time a targeted keg will explode causing massive damage in a fairly large area around it. Simply dodge the targeted keg. You can also knock the kegs with an attack to move them to the edge of the arena.LootSee also:Ilvl 215 Dungeon ArmorandIlvl 215 Dungeon AccessoriesBattle Coeurl10Allagan Tomestone of
