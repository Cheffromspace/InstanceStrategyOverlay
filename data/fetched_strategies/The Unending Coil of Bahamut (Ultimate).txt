Such trials as they overcame were not to be recorded in history, but far from fading with the passage of time, they have been imagined in vivid detail by the wandering minstrel. As his lilting melody caresses your mind's eye, you cannot help but be transported to the scene of struggle against the elder primal Bahamut...— In-game descriptionThe Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)is a level 70ultimate raidintroduced inpatch 4.11withStormblood.

The barrier will disappear when the party initiates combat. It is advised that players pre-place markers to know where to have the first boss dropNeurolink Puddles. Players should also assign a ranged DPS player to baitLiquid Hellsaround the edge of the arena. Players should also assign clock positions to avoid knockback fromRaven's Divein the second phase. Finally, players should break into two light parties to handle breaking into safe zones to baitTwistersin later phases.
It is important to note that there are several different ways to handle mechanics for this fight. This guide will explain mechanics and recommend a basic strategy; however, it is best to see what works for your raid group.Phase 1:TwintaniaAbilities:Plummet(no cast bar): Frontal tankbuster cleave dealing heavy damage to anyone hit.Fireball(no cast bar): A player is marked, and the boss fires a large fireball at that player dealing heavy magic damage. This attack can be split to mitigate damage.Twister: Four random players will have small, dark green tornadoes dropped under where they were standing when the cast bar finishes. Touching these causes instant death and causes a heavy knockback on any player nearby, which will also kill them.Death Sentence: Heavy-hitting tankbuster that also debuffs with aSlashing Resistance DownIIdebuff, causing the boss's auto-attacks to hit much harder. Requires a tank swap.Liquid Hell(no cast bar): A random player past a certain distance from the boss is targeted with five fireball spits, with each spit dealing moderate damage and dropping a large persistent fire puddle. The fire puddles will inflictBurnsto anyone who steps or lingers in them around a second after they appear, killing them after a tick. In a later usage of this ability, a random player regardless of distance will be targeted.Neurolink(no cast bar): The boss will drop a small blackNeurolinkpuddle at its current location. Players who stand in this will receive theNeurolinkdebuff, decreasing their damage dealt by 90% but allowing them to surviveHatchorb explosion, and in phase 3,Aetheric Profusion. This boss will drop a total of threeNeurolinks.Generate: A random DPS player is marked, and a black orb will slowly move towards them. If the player is standing in aNeurolinkpuddle, the orb will explode in a medium-sized AoE (Hatch), dealing minimal damage and inflictingMana Hypersensitivity, which causes being hit by another orb to be fatal until the debuff wears off. Any other players not in aNeurolinkthat are caught in the orb explosion will die. If a player hit is not standing in aNeurolinkpuddle, or if the orb is allowed to linger for too long, the orb will explode and instantly wipe the raid (Deep Hatch).Aetheric Profusion: Enrage. If the boss is not defeated in time, it will become untargetable and cast this ability, wiping the party. In phase 3, this ability deals lethal partywide damage that requires standing in aNeurolinkto survive.Strategy:100% - 74% % HPThe boss will start off by usingPlummet, followed byTwisterandFireball. Players should drop theirTwisterAoE at the edge of the arena, then group up to split theFireballdamage. The boss will then useDeath Sentenceon the main tank. Players should tankswap during the cast. The boss will then repeat these attacks until it reaches 74%, where it will drop its firstNeurolinkpuddle.74% - 44% HPFrom here the boss will start usingGenerateandLiquid Hell.
The tank should move the boss away from the puddle so players can step into theNeurolinkwithout immediately colliding with theGenerateorb and accidentally hitting anyone with the blast. There are several strategies on where to have the boss drop theNeurolinkpuddle, so players should predetermine where they are going to drop it. From here, an assigned player (usually the physical ranged DPS) should stand furthest away from the boss to baitLiquid Hellpuddles, dropping them around the edge of the arena. After dropping theNeurolink, the boss will immediately castLiquid Hell. Have the targeted player move out of the attack and make sure other players don't step into the puddles while moving out of mechanics. The boss will then castGenerateand mark a DPS with three small orbs rotating above them. The boss will then send theHatchorb towards the player. The DPS needs to move inside theNeurolinkand everyone else needs to move away to avoid the splash from the explosion. After sending the orb towards the marked player, the boss will cast anotherLiquid Hell. If the assignedLiquid Hellbaiter is targeted by the firstHatch, another player should move to bait the next set ofLiquid Hells. Alternatively, the assigned baiter can stand at the wall behind theNeurolinkwhile another player (usually a caster or healer) enters theNeurolinkpuddle to intercept the orb. The boss will then follow up withDeath Sentence, requiring another tankswap. The boss will then cast anotherGenerateandTwister. Players will have to bait this attack and wait for theHatchto explode before moving back into the center of the arena. The boss will finally use anotherPlummet, and repeat these attacks in this order until it reaches 44% HP.44% - 0% HPOnce the boss's HP is below 44% it will drop anotherNeurolinkpuddle. From here, the boss will have variations for its two newest attacks. The boss will fire twoGenerateorbs at two different players, and a random player will be targeted byLiquid Helland cannot be baited. The variableLiquid Hellwill always come out in the same order in the rotation. After dropping the secondNeurolink, the boss will start by firing aLiquid Hellat the furthest player, then follow up with aGenerate. Once the orbs are cast, the boss will then immediately target a random player and use the variant ofLiquid Hell. Once the players' marked forGeneratehave handled their orbs, all players except the one targeted byLiquid Hellshould stack forFireballto mitigate the damage. The boss will then castDeath Sentence. requiring a tankswap, another set of orbs on two marked DPS players withTwister, then finally aPlummetto end the rotation. The boss will then cycle through these attacks starting with the firstLiquid Helland continue until it is either defeated or enrages.
If the boss is not defeated after 3 minutes, it will enrage, becoming intangible and castAetheric Profusion, wiping the party.Phase 2:Nael Deus DarnusAbilities:Heavensfall: Raid-wide proximity damage that causes a knockback from the center of the arena and spawns a pillar. Being too close the center will cause lethal damage.Thermionic Burst: TheHeavensfallpillar hits parts of the arena with telegraped conal AoEs, dealing massive damage and inflictingParalysis.Bahamut's Claw: Heavy-hitting tankbuster that hits the main target 5 times.Meteor Stream: An attack that hits four random players, followed by the remaining four. These deal splash damage so players must spread out. If not all eight players are alive, a random player will be hit twice in a row and will likely die.Lunar Dynamo: A large donut AoE with no cast bar. the only safe zones are under the boss or far away.Iron Chariot: A point-blank AoE with no cast bar or size indicator. Deals lethal damage with a knockback.Dalamud Dive: Leaps on tank dealing heavy damage with splash damage. Move away from tank to avoid.Raven's Dive: Leaps on a random player, dealing damage in a small AoE. Anyone else except the primary target in the AoE will be knocked into the wall and killed.Thermionic Beam: Boss fires a laser at a random player, dealing massive damage that needs to be split across other party members. Has no cast bar.Hypernova: A random player will be targeted and an puddle will drop on them. Lingering inside a puddle for too long will inflict a lethalBleedingdebuff.Ravensbeak: Heavy-hitting tankbuster that inflictsPiercing Resistance DownII, requiring a tankswap.Bahamut's Favor: Buffs the boss withDamage Upand summons five dragons around the edge of the arena. Dragons will appear at random cardinals and intercardinals.TheIce Dragonsequentially usesIceballon all players, starting from one random player, debuffing withIcebitten. If a player is hit by a secondIceball, they will die. The debuff can only be removed by theFirescorcheddebuff and will cancel it out as well.TheFire Dragontethers to a random player and hits them withFireball, which deals splash damage and debuffs anyone hit withFirescorched. Any players withFirescorchedwho are hit will die. This can only be removed byIcebittenand also cancels it out.TheThunder Dragoninflicts the debuffThunderstruckon two random players, which resolves in a small AoE around the player. While this AoE does no damage to the afflicted player, it will deal massive damage and inflictParalysisto anyone caught in the AoE.TheLight Dragonwill castWings of Salvation, dropping puddles underneath random players. If players are in these circles when they expire, they will die. When the puddles resolve, they leave behind white circles that players can step into to dispel theDoomdebuff, which will consume the puddles. Note that players withoutDoomcan still step into and consume the puddles, which will make them unavailable for cleanses and lead to deaths.TheDark Dragonwill castDoomon random players with random durations. If the debuff resolves, the player will die. This can be dispelled by walking into the white circles fromWings of Salvation.Cauterize: Thedragonsat the edge of the arena will sequentially mark 3 random players except for the highest enmity player with green markers. When the marker disappears, they will use a massive line AoE aimed the player's location, knocking back and killing anyone hit. Starting from true north, the first two dragons going clockwise will dive at the first marked player, the third dragon will dive at the second marked player, and the fourth and fifth dragon will dive at the third marked player.Megaflare: Enrage. If the boss is not defeated in time, it will become untargetable and cast this ability, wiping the party.Strategy:Naelhas many attacks that don't have any cast bar or indicator that they are coming out. The boss will, however, call out a quote that indicates what attacks will follow the quote. Players need to still be familiar with what attacks follow each quote, but this lets players prepare and position themselves to some degree.
The quotes and their associated attacks are as follows:O hallowed moon, take fire and scorch my foes!-Lunar Dynamo, Thermionic BeamO hallowed moon, shine you the iron path!-Lunar Dynamo, Iron ChariotTake fire, O hallowed moon!-Thermionic Beam, Lunar DynamoBlazing path, lead me to iron rule!-Thermionic Beam, Iron ChariotFleeting light! Amid a rain of stars, exalt you the red moon!-Meteor Stream, Dalamud DiveFleeting light! 'Neath the red moon, scorch your earth!-Dalamud Dive, Thermionic BeamFrom on high I descend, the iron path to call/walk!-Raven's Dive, Iron ChariotFrom on high I descend, the hallowed moon to call!-Raven's Dive, Lunar DynamoIt helps to have someone calling the attacks and how players need to move to minimize players taking damage.
The boss will start the phase by immediately dropping a proximity marker in the center of the room, indicating thatHeavensfallis about to come out. Players should mitigate this damage and use knockback resistance if they have it. After this, glowing conal AoEs will fire from the center where the pillar fell. Players need to avoid these, as if they are hit, the AoE will deal lethal damage, and if a player manages to survive, they are debuffed withParalysis. While the AoEs are resolving, the boss will castMeteor Stream, so players should spread out to avoid overlapping damage. Following this, the boss will useDalamud Diveon the last player who held enmity onTwintania. This also deals splash damage, so players need to stay away.The boss will land and castBahamut's Clawon the main target, then immediately castBahamut's Favor, spawning the 5 dragons at the edge of the arena. The boss will call one of it's quotes, then theThunder Dragonwill inflict two players withThunderstruck. Meanwhile, the boss will castLunar Dynamo. To avoid overlapping players with theThunderstrucksplash, the boss should be pulled to the middle of the arena, the two inflicted players should stand on the flanks of the boss while the party stands in front of the boss.At this point, the quote attacks will come out, so move accordingly to avoid. TheFire Dragonwill tether to a player at this time as well, so make sure to move players in or out depending on what strategy is being used to handle the dragon's debuffs. At this time, two random players will be inflicted withDoom, whileWings of Salvationwill drop puddles that players need to move out of until they resolve, then theDoomedplayers can dispel the debuff. The circles will appear at staggered times, so the player with the shorter version ofDoomwill need to take the first circle, and the player with the longer debuff takes the second. The boss will then useBahamut's Clawson the main tank, and theFire Dragonwill tether to another player, while theThunder Dragonmarks two players forThunderstruck. These players can simply move away from the rest of the party as the boss will not have aLunar Dynamoup at this time.The boss will call another quote, and players will have to adjust. The boss will be castingThermionic Beamfirst, so players should stack for that, then move to avoid the second attack. TheLight DragonandDark Dragonwill cycle through castingDoomandWings of Salvation, however this time, three players will be debuffed withDoomso players will still need to dispel in accordance with who has the shortest duration on theirDoomdebuff. Another two players will be marked forThunderstruck, and a player will be tethered forFireball. However, this time, theThunderstruckdebuff will resolve before theFire DragoncastsFireball, so players will have to spread forThunderstruck, then stack in forFireballif players are debuffing with this one. The boss will follow up with anotherBahamut's Clawon the main tank.The boss will say another quote to determine ifLunar DynamoorIron Chariotwill followRaven's Dive. Since the boss will always useRaven's Divehere, players should stack close to the boss in their assigned clock positions. This lets players avoid getting knocked back and extra damage, while staying close enough to still react to mechanics. When the second attack fires, a tether will come out for anotherFireballwhile two more players are marked byThunderstruck. Like last time, theFireballwill cast afterThunderstruckresolves, so separate first. Immediately after theFireballresolves, three more players will be marked withDoom, while other players are marked withWings of Salvation. After all the wings resolve,Nael Deus Darnuswill castRavensbeakso the tanks will need to swap mid cast. Following this, the boss will say a fourth quote, then 3 random players will be marked with green markers.DivebombsThese green markers indicate that three dragons will useCauterize(i.e., divebomb). Marked players should position these at the edge of the arena, spread far out from each other, and between the dragons. The goal is to have the dragons dive across the edges of the arena while keeping the center safe. While players are setting up forCauterize, the boss will fireHypernovaat the players furthest away. Since players moving forCauterizewill most likely be furthest away, so to handle both these mechanics, wait until the green markers disappear before moving out of the way ofHypernova.
At this point, the attacks for the fourth quote will come out. Players need to pay attention so they know whether to spread forMeteor Streamor stack to mitigateThermionic Beam. Either way, players should move away from the main tank to avoid the splash fromDalamud Divefrom either the first or second attack.Once theCauterizeshave resolved, the dragons' won't be present for the rest of the fight. The boss will useBahamut's Claw, then call out two quotes chosen completely at random from any of the boss's quotes, so players need to pay attention in order to be ready to move. ARavensbeakwill follow this, so be ready to tankswap. This will be followed by anotherBahamut's Claw, then the boss will enrage, become intangible and castMegaflare, wiping the party, so defeat the boss before then.
Once the Nael is defeated, the boss will jump away. Players should heal and prepare to mitigate an incoming attack.Phase 3:Bahamut PrimeAbilities:Flare Breath: Hard-hitting conal cleave dealing magic damage.Tempest Wing: The boss will tether to a random target, then hits the player with an attack that deals splash damage. Anyone hit by the splash damage is also knocked back and stunned. The tether can be picked up by other players.Flatten: Heavy-hitting tankbuster. Mitigate to survive.Earthshaker: A random player will get a marker over their head, and the boss will fire a massive conal AoE at the target, inflicting damage andEarth Resistance DownII. This AoE will also drop a puddle, which inflicts theSludgedebuff if players stand in it.Sludgeis a heavy Damage over Time debuff that will prove lethal to anyone who gets it.Megaflare: Random players are marked with a circle AoE. These players need to stack, while everyone else needs to spread out, as the attack randomly hits players with splash damage. If an unintended player is hit by this splash damage, they will die. Players will also have to dodge AoEs that appear on the ground.Gigaflare: Deals high raid-wide damage, requiring mitigation.The boss will also occasionally leave the arena and call back the previous bosses to perform their mechanics all at once.Strategy:Bahamut Primewill appear and castFlare BreathandFlatten, then summonNael Deus DarnusandTwintaniaQuickmarch Trio.All three bosses will appear next to each other at the edge of the arena and dash through the middle of the arena. This will create safe zones at the adjacent edges to the bosses. The boss will castTwisterat the same time in the safe zone that players need to dodge. It is recommended that players split into their light parties and move to each side to avoid overcrowding ofTwistersin one area. Watch the enemy list to see when the cast will finish. OnceTwistersresolve,Bahamutwill castMegaflareandEarthshaker, which will target both healers and a DPS. The boss will also tether players withTempest Wing.
The best way to handle these mechanics is to have any players marked forMegaflaremove to the southern part of the arena, leaving space in between them to avoid excess splash damage. Have one healer each move to the northeast and northwest of the arena, along with tanks. Be sure to avoid the direct north and south of the arena, as the charge through the arena is quite wide. Move away from where theTwistersdrop, and space out forMegaflaresplash damage, while the marked player’s stack. Have theEarthshakerplayers move to the north, east and west, closer to the edge of the arena. Finally, have the tanks grab the tethers forTempest Wing. Earthshaker will fire, so be careful about overlapping the AoEs, as this will cause lethal damage.Bahamutwill performFlare BreathandFlattenagainBlackfire TrioA player will be marked with aDivebombmarker. Instead of moving to where players drop the marker, the boss will move to where itappearsinstead.Twintaniawill also mark players forLiquid Hell, andNaelwill castThermionic Beamafter that. To handle this mechanic, players should group together and move around the edge of the arena away fromBahamutto bait where the marker appears. Once theDivebombmarker pops up, players can move around the arena to drop theLiquid Hellpuddles at the edge of the arena to avoid them at a later point, thenNaelwill hit a player withThermionic Beam, but since everyone's stacked, the damage will be mitigated well.Naelwill then mark 2 DPS, a healer and a tank withMegaflaremarkers while four pillars will spawn around the arena. Each tower needs a player inside it before it explodes, or it will wipe the party.Naelwill also castHypernovasat players, so players need to dodge out of theHypernovasbefore standing in the towers. TheMegaflareplayers need to stack away from the group at this point.
After the towers resolve,Bahamutwill begin castingGigaflare, so shields and mitigation is required. After castingFlare Breaththree times in a row, the other bosses will return once againFellruin TrioThe three bosses will land in a triangle around the center of the arena.Naelwill use either theRaven's Dive/Lunar Dynamoquote, or the reverse of that.Bahamutwill castTempest Wing, putting out two tethers that need to be picked up by the tanks.Twintaniawill then castAetheric Profusion. The only way to survive is to mitigate using theNeurolinkpuddles. The tanks will take a puddle each, while the rest of the party will step into the remainingNeurolink. Immediately after these attacks resolve,Naelwill castMeteor Stream, so players need to spread out to avoid splash damage.Bahamutwill follow this up with anotherGigaflare, so shields and healing are required. The boss will castFlare Breath,Flattenand anotherFlare BreathHeavensfall TrioThe three bosses will spawn in a line at the edge of the arena.BahamutandTwintaniawill mark players withDivebombmarkers, then charge through the arena towards them. Immediately after,Twintaniawill castTwister, andBahamutwill spawn 8 towers around the arena near the edge. Shortly after,Heavensfallwill cast, dropping a large pillar in the center of the arena, causing knockback. Finally, a player will be marked forFireball, then anotherGigaflare.
To handle these mechanics, players will need to stack in the center of the arena to bait the bosses charging through the arena. Players should observe the order in which the bosses spawned at the edge. IfBahamutandTwintaniaare next to one another, players can split into light parties and move to either side of the arena. IfNael Deus Darnusis between them, the bosses will charge across the arena in a cross pattern, meaning two players in the north, east, south and west is the maximum amount of players that can be in each safe zone. OnceTwistersdrop, players will move closer to the center of the arena, putting their backs to a tower, so whenHeavensfallresolves, players will be knocked back into their towers. After the towers resolve, players need to be ready to dodge the AoEs that fire from the pillar in the center of the arena.Naelwill castHypernovathree times at random players, so move along the edge of the arena to bait these. Following this, a random player will be marked forFireball, so players need to stack to mitigate this. Finally, players will need to mitigate theGigaflarethat follows. The boss will return to the arena and castFlare Breaththree times.Tenstrike TrioTwintaniawill spawn in the center of the arena and mark three players forGenerate, then fire two orbs per marked player. The only way to avoid the orbs exploding and causing fatal damage is to have three players stand in theNeurolinkpuddles and intercept an orb each. While this is resolving,Naelwill castMeteor Streamon each player, and divebomb each of the DPS, the healers, then the tanks. To handle this, players should spread to their clock positions to avoid splash damage and soak the meteors. Following this, four players will be marked forEarthshaker. Marked players should move to the intercardinals to create safe zones at the north and south of the arena. Following this, the other four players will be marked forEarthshakers, and players will need to quickly swap places. It is recommended to quickly call out where each player is going. After this resolves, the boss will castGigaflare,FlattenandFlare Breath, before moving into the final move of the phaseGrand OctetThe 5 dragons and 3 bosses will spawn randomly around the arena. Each player alive will be marked at least once forDivebomb. If any player is downed, a random player will take more than one hit.Naelwill dive across the arena first, in the direction where the marker appears. The 5 dragons will dive in an order based on whereBahamutspawned. If it is at a cardinal position, the dragons will dive counter-clockwise. IfBahamutis at an intercardinal, the dragons will dive in a clockwise order. The dragons dive in the direction when their marker disappears. Following the dragons,Bahamutwill dive in the direction where its marker appeared. Finally,Twintaniawill dive last, in the direction where the marker appeared.Megaflarewill cast at the same time.
There are many ways to handle this, however a common strategy to handle this is to start stacked in the middle. Take note of whereBahamuthas spawned, so players can tell which direction the dragons will begin diving from, wait for the first dive marker to appear, then move to the opposite wall, away fromBahamut. IfNaelis there, move out of the way towards the first dragon to the left ofBahamut, or to the first dragon to the right ifBahamutis at an intercardinal, then move back to the opposite ofBahamut. OnceBahamut'sred dive marker appears, move back to the center of the arena. OnceNaeldives, players will move around the edge of the arena either clockwise or counter-clockwise based on which order the dragons will be diving. After everyone butTwintaniahas dived, the only player that hasn't been marked should move to the right ofTwintaniato bait its dive to the edge of the arena. While this is happening, players will be marked forMegaflareand towers will spawn around the arena. Have marked players stack up on the left ofTwintaniaand the final player bait the attack to the right, then move to the nearest tower. The other players will move to the other towers.Twintaniawill also castTwister, so players will need to dodge out of towers to avoid these. Once all these attacks have resolved, the boss will leave the arena and begin castingTeraflare. It is important to note that ifBahamutis not pushed to at least 60% HP, it will gain aDamage Upbuff that will makeMorn Afahnearly impossible to survive.Phase 4: TeraflareAt this point,Nael Deus DarnusandTwintaniawill both be targetable, and a gauge will appear and begin charging, representing how much the boss has chargedAetherial Attunement. If the gauge reaches 100%, the party will be wiped. Each tank should grab one of the bosses and tank them back-to-back. Each boss needs to be defeated at roughly the same time, otherwise the other will enrage and castTwin Fury/White Fury, completely healing the remaining boss to full, and buffing them withDamage UpandVulnerability Down, essentially leading to a wipe. The bosses both share an enmity table withBahamut Prime, so the off tank will have to provoke one of the bosses. The bosses have all the abilities they had before, and they can be handled the same way.Twintaniawill still use theGenerate/Twistercombo, firing 3Hatchesthis time. Have players resolveGeneratebefore dodging out to baitTwisters. Have a ranged player baitLiquid Hellsto the edge of the arena. It is recommended to have a way marker down to set a location to stack to soakThermionic Beamand spread to clock positions to avoidRaven's Diveknockback. AfterTwistersresolve,Naelwill call out one of four quotes, this time each quote will be three attacks instead of two:Unbending iron, take fire and descend!-Iron Chariot, Thermionic Beam, Raven's DiveUnbending iron, descend with fiery edge!-Iron Chariot, Raven's Dive, Thermionic BeamFrom hallowed moon I bare iron, in my descent to wield!-Lunar Dynamo, Iron Chariot, Raven's DiveFrom hallowed moon I descend, upon burning earth to tread!-Lunar Dynamo, Raven's Dive, Thermionic BeamThe boss will cycle through these moves very quickly, so players need to be aware of what moves are coming out and how to handle them. After these attacks resolve,Naelwill castMegaflare, then the bosses will both use their tankbusters, both of which require tankswaps. From here the bosses will repeat their rotations one more time untilTwister, at which time the bosses will use their tankbusters, then castMegaflare. By the end of these cycles the boss will have filled its gauge and castTeraflare, wiping the raid. If the bosses are both dead and the gauge reaches 100%, the party will still be wiped, but everyone will still be raised byPhoenixcastingFlames of Rebirth. Players will lose all debuffs, regain full HP and a full Limit Break gauge, as well as the buffPhoenix's Blessing, doubling the damage players deal. If a player dies in the final phase, this buff will resolve.Phase 5:Golden Bahamut PrimeAbilities:Morn Afah: A random player will be hit with an untelegraphed stack AoE that deals massive damage and requires additional party mitigation to survive.Akh Morn: A heavy-hitting tankbuster AoE that targets the highest enmity target. Can be shared by both tanks with mitigation or taken by one tank with an invulnerability cooldown. The attack will add one additional hit per use.Exaflare: Three pairs of two medium-sized circle AoEs will sequentially spawn on a random cardinal or intercardinal of the map, in random patterns. These AoEs will travel across the map and kill anyone hit. Tanks may survive with cooldowns but will receive a -50% Damage Down debuff. Players need to watch to see in what order they fire in and move out of the way.Strategy:Note: It is important to avoid deaths early in the phase, as players who die will lose thePhoenix Blessingbuff and deal significantly less damage to the boss (along with the Weakness debuff), probably leading to an enrage wipe. Currently, the DPS check is lenient enough where most parties can afford a handful of deaths, but it is still beneficial to avoid them.When goldenBahamut Primespawns, it will have theLohs Daihbuff, increasing damage dealt. It immediately will begin castingMorn Afah, requiring players to stack for mitigation and shielding. The boss will fire 5Morn Afah'sthrough the fight, so being prepared to mitigate these is crucial to this phase. Because the DPS check is lenient, it may be worthwhile to use a Tank Limit Break for eachMorn Afahto help with mitigation, as the Limit Break guage fills very quickly in this phase. After this resolves, every player other than the tanks need to move away from the boss.Bahamutwill fire 3Akh Morn's. These also need to be mitigated correctly, however, tanks should save their invulnerability skills for the nextAkh Morn. After this, the boss will fireExaflare. Watch to see where the first one fires from, then try to get behind the second one. Some players will pull the boss to the area where the first AoE exploded, since that area is now safe. However, This can be risky, if players move into the area too quickly, or don't move out of the following explosion fast enough, players can take lethal damage.
These attacks will continue in sequence 5 times until the boss enrages. Once the boss enrages, the boss will continuously fire lethal damageMorn Afah'suntil the party wipes. To help in the last few seconds, have players spread out soBahamutkills players one by one to help push DPS until the boss is defeated. The boss will target players in order of decreasing enmity, so it may be beneficial to have the tanks use Shirk on the healers to ensure the DPS are killed last.Reward1Dreadwyrm TotemUnending Coil of Bahamut Adventurer PlateWhen originally released, you could receive only one reward item per week for completing duties in The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate).

All surviving players will receive a -50% Damage Down debuff, but this is  usually a non-issue due to the incredibly lenient DPS check for the phase and the fact that it will fall off before Phase 4.If there are more than two deaths coming into the Fireball stack, the marked player should take the stack solo and sacrifice themselves to prevent killing the rest of the party.Tenstrike TrioGrand OctetIf a level 3 tank limit break is used, the Megaflare stack can be ignored. At least one player should soak each tower. It is recommended to use knockback immunity as a precaution if Twintania's Twisting Dive is baited through the middle to prevent being knocked into the death wall. The limit break also allows one to survive the damage from Twisting Dive. Note that knockback resist willnotprevent death from touching a Twister.Phase 4: AddsNo toolbox available; stack is taken on D marker.Phase 5: Golden BahamutNo toolbox availableReferences↑https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGZ-wFZ5cM8↑https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gi05HqdMSs&t=969s↑https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fEFO5HEYrI&t=272s↑https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivLvPhZ7DQ&feature=youtu.be↑https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RlB53osba4↑https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2119272861RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
