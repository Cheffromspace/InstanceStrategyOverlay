SriLakshmi, patron deity of the Ananta, came forth from the aether, and the imperials were put to flight. Alas, the tale did not end there, for now the Qalyana demand that the Vira come and pay tribute to the goddess. And so it falls to you and your comrades to journey unto the Qalyana stronghold ofDjanan Qhat, and put an end to Sri Lakshmi's dream.— In-game descriptionEmanationis a level 67trialintroduced inpatch 4.0withStormblood.Contents1Strategy1.1Lady of Bliss: Lakshmi2Loot3ImagesStrategyUpdated Shadowbringers guideLakshmi guideLady of Bliss:LakshmiThe trial begins with Lakshmi surrounded by a barrier, and flanked by a pair of Dreamer Ananta. Defeat them to lower Lakshmi's barrier and begin the fight, but bear in mind that Lakshmi will use area of effect attacks that also heal the Dreamers, so the party should concentrate on them one at a time rather than splitting attention.Shortly after she begins fighting for herself, Lakshmi will leave the platform and prepare to use a special attack that is an instant kill on anyone not shielded by the Duty mechanic -Vril. Players can hold a single charge of Vril at any time and activate it whenever they wish; once activated, the charge lasts for around 30 seconds and significantly reduces the effect of Lakshmi's attacks. After this attack has been used once, she will not attempt to use it again during the regular version of the trial.Replacement Vril orbs will spawn shortly before the time comes to actually use them; do not touch an orb if you already have a charge, as it will still consume the orb (meaning another party member won't be able to use it). The main times to use them are when Lakshmi moves to the centre of the platform and casts a platform-wide AoE with no safe zone. This inflicts heavy damage and knockback if you do not use your Vril, and falling off the platform is an instant KO (though you will return to the starting position and can be Raised).Aside from the Vril mechanic, the fight is fairly straightforward and mostly involves positioning her area attacks. Lakshmi will apply the Target Left or Target Right states depending on which "Hand" ability she is using; one corresponds to a circular blue pool effect that grows larger if it deals damage to players, and the other corresponds to cross-shaped effects that originate from 2-3 random players at a time. She will also periodically mark someone with a large orange effect with arrows that point toward the target; when this occurs, stack up to spread the damage.The fight is otherwise fairly straightforward until Lakshmi is defeated, though visually noisy and chaotic. Just don't stand in the AoEs (apart from the one you need to stack for) and you'll be fine.Important informationKill adds 1 at a timeYou will need to pick up a replacement blue orb to use, only pick up oneUse the button ...Shortly after the adds are gone in the beginning of the fightWhen she moves to the centre of the platformLootLakshmi Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)Stotram(Blue Mages)ImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
