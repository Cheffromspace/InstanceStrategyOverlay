As such, they will not march upon Castrum Abania until they can be certain the fortress's main cannon will not be brought to bear against them. With the aid of an Alliance contact in Radiata, you and your comrades have devised a plan to infiltrate the castrum and seize control of the cannon. Several parties, including yours, will attempt to create a diversion inside the castrum, thereby allowing Lyse and her unit of Resistance fighters to proceed relatively unhindered to the fire control center. Weapons research is to be your destination, and one can only imagine what manner of foes await you there...— In-game descriptionCastrum Abaniais a level 69dungeonintroduced inpatch 4.0withStormblood.

Such a weapon was constructed for the purpose of bringing down targets as prodigious as Midgardsormr, but it was no less effective against men, as was made plain during the siege of Specula Imperatoris. Heedless of their comrades fighting within, the Garleans turned the cannon on their own stronghold, inflicting grievous casualties on both sides.As the war for Ala Mhigo’s liberation approached its climax, the armies of the Alliance and the Resistance sought to capture the castrum, but they could not march upon it for fear of the cannon’s barrage. A plan was devised which saw a small contingent infiltrate the garrison and secure control of the weapon. With it thus rendered dormant, the Eorzean Alliance was free to strike, and strike it did with overwhelming force to wrest the castrum from the Empire and secure a crucial foothold in the struggle.InfernoMore monster than machina, this automaton was born of an accident in the course of synthetic muscle development. Unable to be controlled and able only to destroy, it was essentially a failed creation, but it found the castrum’s defense—in part to test its endurance—and was keenly observed by its creator, Aulus.Number XXIVAulus mal Asina sought to infuse pureblood Garleans with fourth the ability to manipulate aether, and with his twenty-fourth subject he finally succeeded. The experiment was not without side effects, however, and the subject exhibited psychological instability. With further live testing, the scientist would go on to create the Resonant.MoreHousing also a facility for the research and development of weaponry, Castrum Abania boasts a well-developed internal transport network for conveying prototypes and provisions.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
