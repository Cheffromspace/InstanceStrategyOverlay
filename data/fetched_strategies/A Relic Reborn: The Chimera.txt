Some say the uniquely fine alumina salts to be found in its capacious stomach are an accident of friction and heat, while others claim intent. Those such as Gerolt, who forge anew the arms of eld, have a simpler question: will you slay the fire-breathing enigma?— In-game descriptionA Relic Reborn: The Chimerais a level 50trialintroduced inpatch 2.16.StrategyDhorme ChimeraAbilitiesLion's Breathis an instant frontal cone attack which deals small amount of damageDragon's Breathis a frontal cone AoE attack that deals moderate amount of damage and inflicts the debuffParalysis.Ram's Breathis a frontal cone AoE attack that deals moderate amount of damage and inflicts the debuffHeavy.Scorpion's Stingis a rear cone AoE attack that deals moderate amount of damage and inflicts the DoTPoison.The Dragon's Voiceis a massive AoE attack that deals heavy damage and inflicts the debuffParalysisto all targets outside of melee range.[1]The Ram's Voiceis a large circular AoE attack that deals heavy damage and inflicts the debuffFrostbiteto all targets near Chimera.[1]Cacophonyis an instant ability that summons a electrical orb.

The quest will still progress.When the battle begins players should pull the boss to the outdoor area outside of the cave. By doing this the party will have more room to maneuver. Throughout the boss fight, melee players should avoid Dragon's Breath and Ram's Breath when possible. They should also avoid staying behind the boss and triggering Scorpion's Sting. The Breath attacks can also beinterruptedandstunned. Ranged damage dealers and healers should spread out across the battle field. When the boss uses Cacophony on a player, he or she should move away from other players.Esunais critical for clearing debuffs!When Chimera begins to use Ram's Voice, all melee players should move out of the melee range of the boss. When Chimera begins to use Dragon's Voice, all ranged players should move to the melee range of the boss.Players should always be aware and move out of the Ram's Keeper, a large circular ground indicator, as soon as possible.LootAlumina Salts-A Relic Rebornactive and on the correct step.TrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
