submissionDungeon ImagesLoreRemnants Of The Fifth Astral EraLong ago, in the dawn of the Fifth Astral Era, the modest nation of Skalla was founded in the land of Gyr Abania. Over the span of several centuries, its people constructed a grand city of stone at the bottom of a steep-walled ravine, but even this natural defense could not protect Skalla from destruction during a terrible age of war. When the great flood of the Sixth Umbral Calamity later swept across the realm, the hollow ruins of the city were lost to sight, its remnants submerged beneath a raging sea.Over a thousand years later, the city of Ala Mhigo would be built atop Skalla’s forgotten grave in the salt-laden depths of Loch Seld. Yet some few remembered, among them the last king of Ala Mhigo, Theodoric. Towards the end of his brutal reign, growing ever more paranoid over imagined threats to his crown, he had his own family members imprisoned on invented charges. Their wealth was seized and hidden away within the ruins of Skalla, while they themselves were put to guarding it—as abominations transformed by court thaumaturges.These dark truths were brought to light following Ala Mhigo’s liberation, in the course of an investigation by the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. Braving the horrors that lurked Skalla’s crumbling halls, they discovered a veritable mountain of riches: the mad kings legendary trove. In a heartwarming tale with which no few readers will already be familiar, the treasure was placed in the hands of Ala Mhigo’s interim government to be used to rebuild the nation and provide relief to the poor.The Old OneEncountered within the halls of Skalla, this animated guardian’s clay body is somehow evocative of the Far East. While its actual origin is unclear, it was likely borne to Ala Mhigo during the city-state’s days as a waypoint for trade.Hrodric PoisontongueCousin to Theodoric, the last king of Ala Mhigo, the noble-born Hrodric was fifth in line to the throne. Compelled by an unwavering sense of justice, he made frequent attempts to counsel and calm the volatile monarch, but such efforts were construed as an act of treason. For this imagined crime, Hrodric suffered a terrible punishment, and was cursed to forever inhabit the form of a monstrous beast.MoreSuspicious of his own countrymen, Theodoric invited eastern mages to his court. The distinctive brands of enchantment observed throughout the ruins of Skala are suspected to be their handiworkDungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
