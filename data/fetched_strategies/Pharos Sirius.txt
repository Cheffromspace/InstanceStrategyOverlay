Recognizing the need to provide vessels with safe passage through these treacherous waters, the Admiral of Limsa Lominsa ordered the construction of a great lighthouse. So it was that Pharos Sirius came into being, shortly before dusk fell upon the Sixth Astral Era.For a time, Pharos Sirius served seafarers faithfully, the radiance of its aether-fueled lantern piercing the blackest night. Alas, its light was prematurely extinguished by the Calamity, the destruction wrought by Bahamut leaving vast parts of the structure in ruin. Corrupted crystals and aether alike now pervade its halls and passageways, and the reconstruction effort is at a standstill.Worst still, if rumors can be believed, the dreaded siren of Umbra has returned to claim Pharos Sirius for her domain. Dauntless adventurers must venture within and defeat the seductress and her legion of undead minions if this beacon of civilization is to shine once more.— In-game descriptionPharos Siriusis a level 50dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.1.Contents1Objectives2Enemies3Bosses3.1Symond the Unsinkable3.2Zu3.3Tyrant3.4Siren4Loot4.1Symond the Unsinkable4.2Zu4.3Tyrant4.4Siren4.5Treasure Coffers4.5.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 11.1 Y: 10.6)4.5.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 11.1 Y: 10.9)4.5.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 10.4 Y: 12.3)4.5.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 12.0 Y: 11.0)5Achievements6Images6.1Dungeon Images7Lore7.1Drawn By The Light7.2Siren7.3Subterranean Incursion7.4The Progenitrix8DialogueObjectivesClear the Aether Pump: 0/1Clear the Second Spire: 0/1Clear the Fuel Chamber: 0/1Clear the Aether Compressor: 0/1Defeat theSiren: 0/1EnemiesSirius LeechSirius PugilSirius ElbstSirius UragniteZombie SailorZombie BarberZombie War HoundBhootCorrupted SpriteDrifting SoulCorrupted SlimeScreamerZu EggZu PulletZu CockerelCorrupted PuddingZombie Storm PrivateZombie Storm SergeantBossesSymond the UnsinkablePharos Sirius GuideAbilities in this encounter add a stack of Corrupting Crystal to each player. At three stacks, it will explode, dealing damage to all nearby players.Stay spread out, avoid the long, narrow column attack, and kill the hounds as quickly as possible to limit stacks.When the large circles appear, quickly move to one side of the room. It can be beneficial for the ranged to go to one side, while the melee go to the other to prevent an explosion from killing everyone. These circles will leave a persistent yellow pool which adds more stacks of the debuff.If you reach 3 stacks of the debuff, run away from everyone. Since you are at 3 stacks, you can run into the yellow pool if you have to.Around 15% HP, either use the melee LB to end the boss, or use the caster LB to kill the 3-4 hounds that spawn.ZuTank: Face the boss away from the group.Healer: Be prepared for a lot of AoE healing.There are two types of eggs, spotted and plain. The plain eggs spawn an add that does a minor AoE while the spotted eggs spawn an add that channels onto a player.
Ignore the eggs until the emote "The egg is threatening to hatch," which will cause 2-3 eggs to start to glow purple. Only kill one of them. If one of them is a spotted egg, kill it. If more than one is killed, Zu will useFlying Frenzyand bodyslam a party member, which can easily kill someone.Dancers should avoid usingStandard Finishas this will destroy multiple eggs at once.When Zu flies into the air, kill any adds that are alive. While in the air, Zu will place ground effects under the tank. Also uses theBlue MagespellSonic Boom.TyrantTank: Face the boss away from the group and pick up the Sailor adds.Move out of the circular AoE that appears under Tyrant during Bombination.The boss seems to have quite low HP. Either AoE the adds with the boss or just burn the boss down.SirenTank: Position the boss near the center of the room and be ready to pick up the Zombie Storm Privates. Kite the Zombie Storm Sergeants.Healer: A debuff,Siren Song, will be placed on random party members when the Siren castsSong of Torment. You have 12 seconds to heal them to full HP or they will becomecharmedfor a period of time. You should also remove theBleeddebuff, which is applied to the tank periodically.Along with Storm Privates, Zombie Storm Sergeants will also spawn. These will slowly move towards a target and should be kited while the DPS kill them. If they reach their target, they will stun them.
When Siren vanishes, she will either appear in the center of the room or on an edge. If she is in the middle, stack on top of her to avoid getting hit with an AoE Siren Song debuff. If she is on an edge, move out from in front of her to avoid a charge.InterruptLunatic Voice to avoid an AoE healing reduction debuff. It is removable withEsunaif it does go off.LootSee also:Ilvl 60 Dungeon ArmorandIlvl 60 Dungeon AccessoriesSymond the Unsinkable5Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAustere

Sirius.-2.1ImagesDungeon ImagesLoreDrawn By The LightSituated upon the Isles of Umbra, this colossal lighthouse was erected to guide ships safely through the treacherous reefs near Aleport. Its light shone by means of a revolutionary mechanism developed by Naldiq & Vymelli’s, which channeled the land’s aether into the crystal housed in the beacon chamber before releasing it again. As the Calamity wreaked havoc upon the realm, however, the lighthouse was struck clean through by a hail of fireballs causing vast amounts of aether to spew forth. That aether solidified all at once, leaving behind the dynamic formation of corrupted crystals that remains lodged in the structure to this day. Though its original light has ceased to shine, Pharos Sirius continues to function after a fashion owing to the crystals' glow. Concerns grew over its structural integrity, however, and craftsmen were sent in to carry out repairs—only to be driven out by a dread fiend. A siren of seafaring legend had taken up residence within the lighthouse, and intrepid adventurers were called upon to evict this unwelcome tenant.SirenWith their enthralling song, these seductive she-devils of the waves have lured many sailors to a watery demise. Some years ago, the pirate king Mistbeard hunted down the creatures, and for a time their ruinous voices were not to be heard upon the five seas. Following the Calamity, however, a siren would appear upon the Isles of Umbra—or what few of their kind that remained being drawn, it would seem, to corrupted crystals.Subterranean IncursionWith the siren silenced at the adventurers' hands, the restoration of Pharos Sirius could begin in earnest, but it was not long ere trouble arose once more—from the very foundations of the lighthouse. As the men and women of Naldiq & Vymelli’s went about their work, they suddenly found themselves overrun by an order of kobolds. In a bid to move their troops into Limsa Lominsa undetected, the beastmen had dug a tunnel stretching from O'Ghomoro, but a miscalculation brought them to the Isles of Umbra instead.Upon being alerted, the Maelstrom swiftly assembled a small yet capable unit of adventurers. Borne to the beacon chamber by airship, they fought their way down the tower, level by level, and pushed back the forces of the kobolds.The ProgenitrixThe Progenitrix is a prototype bomb developed by ambitious Kobold alchemists seeking to accelerate the pace at which they tunnel the stony hearts of crag, and for. Creating a bomb of this size requires a past to accept the possibility of lethal explosion during the compression process. For the kobolds, however, the exponential gain in potency appears to be worth risking a horrible, fiery death.DialogueSiren:adrift...my embrace...come hither... ♪Siren:...shame...fated ones...in flames...♪Siren:...the sea...forever...with me...♪Siren:My song...silenced...in darkness...quiet...DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
