Courtesy of Y'shtola's magicks, the beastman aetheryte is now primed to send you to a confrontation with the Lord of Crags. Gird your loins for a struggle of titanic proportions.— In-game descriptionThe Navelis a level 34trialintroduced inpatch 2.0.Contents1Duty Support2Strategy2.1Lord of Crags: Titan3ImagesDuty SupportScion MarauderScion ConjurerScion ThaumaturgeScion LancerClassMarauderConjurerThaumaturgeLancerRoleTankHealerDPSDPSStrategyTitan GuideLord of Crags:TitanThe fight is rather straightforward. Titan periodically stomps causing damage to the entire party, but he sticks to melee attacks on his primary target until 80% HP.At 80%, Titan will jump in the air and leave the battlefield, only to return a few seconds later doing massive AoE damage and destroying the walls around the platform. A red ring will take up the outer edge, indicating where the ground will crumble away. Standing as close to the ring as possible will also reduce the damage taken from the attack. Titan will then gain the ability to send out a large shockwave in a line that will knock players off the platform to their death. There is plenty of time to dodge this attack and it should always be avoided.At around 50%, Titan will leap into the air once again and come back down dealing damage. Shortly thereafter, Titan's heart will be exposed and Titan himself will no longer be attackable. Titan's heart needs to be killed as fast as possible to prevent the upcoming enrage from wiping the party. At this point, he also gains the ability to encase a party member in a rock tomb similar to the bubble mechanic from Hellbender inBrayflox's Longstop, though the tomb will not allow the CC'd person to cast spells unlike the bubble, so it's best to clear this quickly.Once the heart has been destroyed, Titan gains one final ability on top of all his previous ones to call down rocks from the ceiling. He will also use his stomp twice in succession. Aside from the one new ability, Titan is easily killed after his heart has been destroyed. Avoiding the falling rocks, dodging his shockwave, and quickly freeing other party members are the keys to staying alive and defeating him. In this phase, Titan has an attack rotation. He will cast the rock tomb (gaol) two punches after every landslide.ImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
