Alas, no voyage across the five seas is entirely uneventful. The ship has been dragged off-course by a mysterious force, and the men have begun to whisper of strange "things" in the water. Needless to say, you and your fellow adventurers will be having none of that. Once the ship reaches its unknown destination, you will go ashore and deal with whatever fiends you find.— In-game descriptionThe Sirensong Seais a level 61dungeonintroduced inpatch 4.0withStormblood.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Lugat3.2The Governor3.3Lorelei4Loot4.1Lugat4.2The Governor4.3Lorelei4.4Additional Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 11.3 Y: 9.2)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 9.5 Y: 10.6)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 11.7 Y: 15.7)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 10.7 Y: 18.2)4.4.4.1Miss List5Achievements6Images7Lore7.1A Prison In The Mist7.2The Governor7.3Lorelei7.4MoreDuty SupportCarvallainAlphinaudLyseAlisaieClassMarauderAcademicianPugilistRed MageRoleTankHealerDPSDPSObjectivesArrive at Spae Rock. 0/1DefeatLugat. 0/1Arrive at the Warden's Delight. 0/1Defeatthe Governor. 0/1Arrive at Glowering Krautz. 0/1DefeatLorelei. 0/1BossesThe Sirensong Sea Dungeon GuideLugatTry to stay near this boss - it will help you avoid his half-screen AOEs.Amorphous Applause: Large directional AOE.

Graveyard10Discover every location withinthe Ship Graveyard.-4.0ImagesLoreA Prison In The MistEast of the Drown and southwest of Thavnair, there lies an expanse of water which legend holds is the haunt of sirens, the scourge of sailors. While indeed named for the seductive fiends, some explorers have suggested that the sea’s reputation is but a fishwives' tale intended to warn people away from its actual danger—a nigh ever-present blanket of thick fog. However, this theory does not account for the unsettling, reports of vessels lurching violently despite calm conditions. Whatever the truth may be, one thing was never in dispute: countless ships have
vanished within these waters.Approximately a century ago, out of concern for the impact upon trade, the magistrate of Radz-at-Han ordered the construction of a lighthouse on the Sirensong Sea. A suitable isle was found, and a host of convicts was brought over to build not only the lighthouse, but also a prison wherein they would be held afterwards. Yet though the work was completed without incident, every single ship sent to deliver supplies and relieve the guard never reached its destination. Under these circumstances, operations could not be sustained, and within a matter of years the isle was abandoned.The GovernorAccording to Hannish records, like so many before it, the vessel dispatched to bring home the prisoners and their guards never returned. Waiting for rescue to no avail, the isle’s denizens eventually perished only to rise again as undead.LoreleiEn route to the Far East, the Misery was shaken by a mysterious force and set adrift upon a current. The vessel was eventually deposited on the abandoned prison isle, the lighthouse rising ominously in the distance. Within the tower, members of the voyage encountered and vanquished a peculiar fiend believed to have originated the legend of the Sirensong Sea. While information is limited, the creature is conjectured to be a type of undead born of the soul of a deceased siren.MoreAn artist’s rendering of the lighthouse and surrounding waters. Dubbed “Glowering Krautz,” its light source is believed to be a result of a certain form of alchemy, but whether it continues to burn in the absence of caretakers is unknown.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
