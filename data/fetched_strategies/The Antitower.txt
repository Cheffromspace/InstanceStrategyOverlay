To sound the deepest depths, to study the aetherial sea itself─for these purposes and more was the Antitower built. Abandoned by her Sharlayan caretakers following the exodus, it has since been overrun by the magical guardians they left behind. Yet were one blessed with Her gift to brave these dangers and descend to the furthest reaches─to hear, feel, and think at the heart of this world─what would they find?— In-game descriptionThe Antitoweris a level 60dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.2withHeavensward.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Zuro Roggo3.2Ziggy3.3Calcabrina4Loot4.1Zuro Roggo4.2Ziggy4.3Calcabrina4.4Additional Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 15.0 Y: 15.8)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 14.2 Y: 14.6)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 16.4 Y: 9.9)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 16.8 Y: 8.2)5Achievements6Images6.1Dungeon Images6.2Other Images7Lore7.1A Porthole To The Aetherial Sea7.2Zuro Roggo7.3Calcabrina7.4MoreDuty SupportThancredAlphinaudY'shtolaClassArchonAcademicianArchonRoleTank or DPSHealer or DPSDPSObjectivesClear the Manifest. 0/1Clear Where Hearts Leap. 0/1Clear Where All Witness. 0/1BossesThe Antitower Guide (Updated for 6.3)Zuro RoggoThe first boss in the dungeon.

(credits:TrustInsighters)Dungeon Dialogue Infographic Part 2Dungeon Dialogue Infographic Part 3LoreA Porthole To The Aetherial SeaIn the year 1311 of the Sixth Astral Era, scholars from the northern nation of Sharlayan discovered natural caverns that descended deep into the subterrane of the Dravanian hinterlands. Judging the site ideal for observing the aetherial sea—the heart of Hydaelyn Herself—they constructed an observatory, the Antitower, and proceeded to study the fate of the very star. As the tower underwent expansion, so too did the little settlement that serviced it grow. This settlement came to assume the role of a waypoint for successive scholarly expeditions to Eorzea before eventually blossoming into the city-state of Sharlayan.Generations later, as the exodus drew near, there were calls for the Antitower to be demolished in order to prevent its misuse. However, its immeasurable academic value ultimately prevailed, and instead it was locked behind a slew of protective seals, whose care was left to the lone individual who chose to remain behind, the Archon Matoya.Zuro RoggoBoasting extraordinary size and girth, this poroggo familiar fled its Sharlayan creators during the exodus and sought to establish a kingdom of its own kind inside the Antitower. With a voice lauded as divine by its peers, it croons out songs that brim with magical power.CalcabrinaThis doll-like construct was created to protect the sanctity of the Antitower. Steeped in the energies of generations of mages, the powerful magicks instilled in this guardian have worked certain transmutations upon its form, which it conceals by dividing itself into lesser dolls, Calcabrina and Brina.MoreIn the depths near the aetherial sea, the laws of nature are in disarray and the hold of gravity weakened. To facilitate movement in such an environment, the Sharlayans employed arcane platforms and teleportation devices.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
