In the years following the Calamity, the notorious Serpent Reavers claimed it as their lair, until the cutthroats were vanquished by a band of dauntless adventurers. The place subsequently came under the control of Lominsan authorities, who maintained a security presence within. Alas, that control did not last, for an unknown faction has arisen─seemingly from the briny depths─and overwhelmed the occupying Yellowjackets. Opinion is divided over the identity of these foes. Some say that they are pirates, while others swear that they are fiends. Yet it does not take a scholar to see that these two things need not be mutually exclusive.— In-game descriptionSastasha (Hard)is a level 50dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.4.Contents1Objectives2Enemies3Bosses3.1Karlabos3.2Captain Madison3.3Kraken4Loot4.1Karlabos4.2Captain Madison4.3Kraken4.4Other Loot4.4.1Treasure Coffer (X:7.5, Y:16.3)5Achievements6Images7Dialogue7.1Cutscene7.2Duty Dialogue7.3CutsceneObjectivesDefeatKarlabos: 0/1Clear the Pull: 0/1DefeatCaptain Madison: 0/1Defeat First Mate Haerstymm: 0/1Defeat theKraken: 0/1EnemiesDripping SalletSpelaean SlugDrowned DeckhandDrowned SteersmanDrowned Powder MonkeyDrowned LodesmanDrowned BoatswainSastasha PugilGrotto PiranuBeryl CrabCave CrabBrineDrowned CourtesanDrowned WenchCaptain's BoyCaptain's GuardCaptain's LeechCaptain's SlaveDrowned TopmanFirst Mate HaerstymmTentacleKraken's ArmBossesSastasha HM Video GuideKarlabosKarlabos will drop Aqua Balls on players to apply a damage-over-time (DoT) debuff calledSlime. Remove the DoT ASAP withEsuna. He will also target the highest-enmity party member withPrey. A few seconds later, Karlabos will stun the player holding the Prey effect. Prey can be passed to other players by physically running into them, resulting in a stun on that player instead. His next attack isTail Screw, which he will use on a player that is not the tank. Tail Screw will bring the player to 1% of theirHP, but will not kill them; however, the player will die if they have the Slime debuff on them. Tail Screw can be stunned; if possible, the tank should pass Prey to a nearby DPS before being stunned so they are able to stun Tail Screw immediately after.The Aqua Balls that apply Slime can overlap to inflict Slime on nearby players. Players can therefore have more than 1 Slime debuff at a time. Avoid standing too close to other players; otherwise, the healer might need to remove Slime several times from a single party member before the Tail Screw attack is used. As long as no one has the debuff, the highest priority after that is keeping the tank's health high.So in short, the healer's priorities are as follows:Remove Slime debuff from everyone before Tail Screw attack > Keep tank health up > Keep party members' health up.Captain MadisonKill theCaptain's Guardadds as soon as they spawn because they are quite weak. After Captain Madison charges a player and knocking them back. He immediately marks a random player and starts shooting at them with his gun. He will keep shooting until enough damage is dealt to him. He cannot be stunned while firing. At very low HP, Captain Madison will spawn a bunch of adds then run away.Players should gather in the center of the boss room for the 3rd set and the 4th set (final set) of adds then AoE them down. Use casterLimit Breakon the 3rd set if needed.DUMP DPS on him after he charges someone and starts shooting because he will keep shooting until enough damage is dealt.KrakenWhen only Kraken and Tentacles are up, attack Kraken and ignore TentaclesWhen Kraken, Tentacles and Kraken's Arms are up, kill Kraken's Arms and ignore Tentacles.When Kraken and 6 Kraken's Arms are up, just try to survive.Attack Kraken and Kraken's Arms, ignore Tentacles.TheInk JetAOE attacks are not worth dodging.Healersshould remove theBlindthey cause before resuming normal healing activities.Alternative Method:Players should pick an Arm that is near the boss and is in a corner then kill the Arm.
