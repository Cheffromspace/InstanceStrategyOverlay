Like you, he is here for answers, seeking the source of an aetheric disturbance culminating in loss of contact with the gaol housing the ancients' most dangerous creations.

Move to the side that he isn't spinning his flail on to dodge this attack. Note that the boss sometime rotates before casting this attack.As the fight continues, Erichthonios begins using this attack during other attacks, without a cast bar indicator. Watch for his flail while dodgingIntemperate TorrentandAetherchain.Pitiless Flail: Erichthonios targets a random player with a line AoE telegraph that follows that player. On hit, knocks back the targeted player, as well as anyone else in the line. The targeted player needs to get close to Erichthonios so they're not pushed out of the arena, while other players should avoid the attack entirely. Immediately after this attack resolves, the targeted player will be marked with a stack marker, and needs to run back to the group for the stack.Heavy Hand: Tankbuster.Warden's Wrath: A slow cast that deals heavy raidwide damage.Intemperance: Gives every raid member the debuffOverwhelmed by FireorOverwhelmed by Cold, indicated by a red or blue triangle floating over their heads. The arena is broken into quarters, each with three crystals floating above it.Intemperate Torrent: Erichthonios will cast this spell three times. Each time, the crystal at thebottomof each stack will explode, dealing fire damage if it is red or cold damage if it is blue. If you are overwhelmed by the element you are struck with, you will take extra damage, so players with the red debuff want to be hit by the blue attack, and vice versa. If you are on the purple cross between the zones, you will take heavy damage. After each hit, your element will swap to the same color as what you were just hit by, so you need to alternate which color crystal you're hit by.For example, if you start with a red triangle over your head (Overwhelmed by Fire), you'd want to be in a quarter of the room where thebottomcrystal is blue (ice). When that explodes, your debuff will turn blue (Overwhelmed by Cold), and you'd want to make sure you're in a quarter of the room with a red crystal at the bottom of the stack, then a quarter with a blue crystal for the final burst. Note that some quarters have different colored crystals stacked, so you may not need to move between bursts if the new bottom crystal in the quarter you are in is already of the opposite color.After the firstIntemperancephase, Erichthonios will begin charging upGaeoler's Flailstrikes that hit after the elemental explosions, making two of the four quarters of the room unsafe. Watch his hands and move to the side of the boss that is safe, and to the quarter within that half of the room that has the correct color on the bottom for your debuff.Shining Cells: This attack deals unavoidable raidwide damage, slightly shrinks the arena, and then divides the arena into alternating red and blue wedges.Aetherchain: Colored orbs will circle Erichthonios. When the cast completes, all wedges that match the color of his orbs will explode. Move to a wedge that is the opposite color.Aetherflail: After the first two casts ofAetherchain, Erichthonios will begin castingGaeoler's JailduringAetherchain. This attack will strike the half of the arena he's whirling his chain on at the same time that the wedges that match the color of his orbs explode. Find a wedge of the opposite color that is also on the safe side of the boss.Slam Shut: Ends theShining Cellsphase, dealing unavoidable raidwide damage.Loot10Allagan Tomestone of Causality5Allagan Tomestone of ComedyErichthonios Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityUnsung Helm of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Armor of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Chausses of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Ring of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityUnsung Helm of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Gauntlets of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Greaves of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Ring of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1DialogueErichthonios: I must save them...
