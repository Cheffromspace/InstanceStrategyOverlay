Worshipped by a Meracydian race of centaur-like beings, this eikon manifested upon the physical plane as an embodiment of eternal victory. And yet, despite his godlike might, Zurvan was captured. He has languished in hisAllagan-made prison now for five thousand years, his primal desire for justice swelling in magnitude with each passing millennium...— In-game descriptionContainment Bay Z1T9is a level 60trialintroduced inpatch 3.5withHeavensward.Contents1Strategy1.1The Demon: Zurvan1.2Phase 11.3Phase 21.4Phase 31.5Phase 42Loot3ImagesStrategyThe Demon:ZurvanUpdated Shadowbringers GuideZurvan (Normal) GuideZurvan utilizes the following moves and mechanics throughout a total of four phases.Phase 1The fight begins on a large platform divided into noticeable quarters which, as the fight progresses, eventually fall in a counterclockwise pattern starting from the east. Anyone standing on falling segments of the platform will immediately perish. When the last remaining quarter of the platform drops, Phase 2 begins.Metal Cutteris a frontal cleave that periodically targets the main tank. Due to this, the main-tank should make sure that Zurvan is faced away from the group until there is only one remaining segment of the platform left.Flare Stardrops circular AoE's on random players which should be avoided.Phase 2Phase 2 begins after the last remaining section of the platform drops down, causing all remaining players to fall into a new arena.Zurvan will begin chargingSoar, which will cause him to jump away from the arena once fully cast. During this, Zurvan will cast 2 line-AoE's from himself that should be avoided, followed by clones of Zurvan that will appear on the outer edges of the arena that will also cast line-AoE's in a similar manner.Flaming Halberdwill occur shortly after Zurvan has leapt from the arena usingSoar. At first, two players are targeted by waves of circular AoEs that will follow their movements. Targeted players should move away from the group to avoid inflicting unnecessary damage. Once complete, a flaming puddle will be left behind.Demonic Diveis cast immediately afterFlaming Halberdat a random Healer, assuming one is alive. This is a basic stack-mechanic where players should group up to absorb as much damage as possible.After landing, Zurvan will turn towards a random player and begin castingWave Cannon, an unmarked line-AoE that the target should side-step to avoid being damaged.Ice Puddleis a persistent AoE puddle centred on the boss (about the size of Zurvan's hitbox) which will inflict damage and slow the movement of anyone who stands within it.Biting Halberdcan only be used afterIce Puddle, which is a massive conal AoE. To avoid being hit, players should move behind Zurvan himself.Southern Crosswill cause multiple AoE's to target random players. Ideally, players should stack up so that these AoE's land on top of each other, providing more space to dodge the following mechanics.Ciclicleis a massive donut AoE, centred on Zurvan, that is cast immediately afterSouthern Cross. To avoid this attack, players must remain close to Zurvan himself.Tail Endis a huge AoE cast straight afterCicliclewhich is centred on Zurvan while he is in the middle of the room. To avoid this, players must move to the outer edges of the arena.Phase 3Phase 3 consists of dealing with multiple waves of adds.Wave 1includes threeExecrated Threwwhich spawn at the northern end of the arena. These should be picked up by a tank and burned down as soon as possible.Wave 2involves a mixture ofExecrated ThrewandExecrated Will.Wave 3contains twoExecrated Will, which should be picked up by the tanks, and oneExecrated Wit(caster add) which should be focused down by the rest of the party as soon as possible.Phase 4This phase begins after all adds are slain. For the most part, it is identical to Phase 2, except for a few additional abilities.Zurvan will castBroken Seal, which causes the following effects in sequence:Infinite Firewill be randomly assigned to up to four players, which will be used to deal withFire Meteor.Infinite Icewill be assigned to the remaining four players, which will be used to deal withIce Meteor.Fire & Ice Meteorswill begin descending around the arena in a triangular pattern, displayed as red or white. Players that were marked byInfinite Fireshould stand within the red meteor, while players withInfinite Iceshould stand within the white meteor. It is worth noting that only the marked player needs to stand in the appropriate meteor to soak damage. However, should meteors remain unsoaked, or if players stand in the wrong meteors, the entire party will be inflicted with a stack of Vulnerability.Tyrfingis a multi-strike tankbuster which increases in attacks each time it is used, starting at 5 strikes and growing to 6, 7, and so on with each use.Loot15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsZurvan Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)ImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
