NoticeAll Lv. 50 Bahamut raids do not appear in anyDuty Roulettesdue to their high difficulty (comparable to Savage). Therefore, attempting to queue throughDuty Finderwill result in extremely long queues. For an easy completion, it is recommended that players useParty Finderand form anUnrestricted Party(i.e., with level sync disabled). Players who wish to complete this duty with level sync enabled should also form a pre-made party, which also enables the use ofMinimum Item LevelandSilence Echosettings for an additional challenge.This article is about the level 50 challenge-moderaid.

Its true identity is the Ragnarok, a colossal starship which fell away from the lesser moon moments before Bahamut burst free of his prison over the Carteneau Flats. To reach your destination, you must venture through this relic of ancient Allag. Stay ever on your guard, for every shadow may conceal dangers.— In-game descriptionThe Binding Coil of Bahamut - Turn 3is a level 50raidintroduced inpatch 2.0. The raid is also known asT3.Contents1Strategy2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 10.7 Y: 10.7)2.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 10.0 Y: 11.1)3AchievementsStrategyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut Turn 3 GuideUniquely, this duty consists of a jumping puzzle and lacks a boss or tomestone reward for completion. The goal is to descend toward the bottom via jump pads, with blue rings indicating the path downward. Mobs and treasure chests are strewn about but are relatively negligible, though keeping distance from the Golems is advisable for weaker party members. Staying together and assigning a single person to lead the way down can help, as the jump pads must be pointed in a specific direction by standing on one of the nearby blue circles prior to standing in the middle to jump down.As there is no final boss, this duty will not grantThe Echo, unlike the other Coils raids.LootTreasure Coffer 1 (X: 10.7 Y: 10.7)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityX-PotionMedicineN/AABasic1X-EtherMedicineN/AABasic1Hi-ElixirMedicineN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 10.0 Y: 11.1)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityX-PotionMedicineN/AABasic1X-EtherMedicineN/AABasic1Hi-ElixirMedicineN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: The Binding Coil of Bahamut III10Discover every location within thethird turn of the Binding Coil of Bahamut.-2.0RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
