Or rather, it was, until an order of kobolds forced workers to evacuate. The Maelstrom has been swift to plan a retaking of the tower, but time is of the essence. The kobolds' love for explosives will surely spell destruction if the beastmen are not purged with utmost haste. Once again, Limsa Lominsa asks for your aid. Descend to the depths of the tower this time, and assist in defusing the kobold threat.— In-game descriptionPharos Sirius (Hard)is a level 60dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.1withHeavensward.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Ghrah Luminary2.28th Order Patriarch Be Gu2.3Progenitrix and Progenitor3Loot3.1Ghrah Luminary3.28th Order Patriarch Be Gu3.3Progenitrix and Progenitor3.4Additional Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 11.3 Y: 10.0)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 10.9 Y: 10.5)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 10.7 Y: 9.7)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 8.8 Y: 9.6)4Achievements5Images5.1Gear Images5.2Dungeon Images6Dialogue6.1Dungeon DialogueObjectivesArrive in the fuel chamber: 0/1Slay theGhrah Luminary: 0/1Arrive in the second spire: 0/1Slay8th Order Patriarch Be Gu: 0/1Arrive at Incubator 66: 0/1Secure Incubator 66: 0/1BossesPharos Sirius HM Dungeon Guide by MizzteqPharos Sirius HM Dungeon GuideGhrah LuminaryGhrah Luminary will createCorruptionsthat tether and mark players with Prey. The Corruptions will castAetheric Mimicry, and marked players should run up to one of the passive mobs circling the room to pass the debuff before the cast finishes. After a short time, the afflicted mob will transform and become aggressive; these have very little HP and should die easily. Note that the spider mobs will leave behind a small pool of poison when they die, so be sure to pull them aside before killing.8th Order Patriarch Be GuThe boss will periodically perform a room-wide AoE that opens a fissure in the floor. Aether will leak out from these fissures until they are plugged by pulling a Corrupted Gel add and killing it on top of the plume. Eventually, the boss will summon a set of Kobold adds in addition to one or more purple Alchemy Engines; these engines provide a tether to the boss and should be destroyed immediately.ProgenitrixandProgenitorProgenitrix will periodically summon a mixture of Grey bombs and Lava bombs around the perimeter of the arena. The Grey bombs should be killed immediately. Once Progenitrix is killed, Progenitor will spawn. Like his predecessor, Progenitor will also summon Grey bombs around the perimeter of the arena; however, they will be accompanied by blue Remedy bombs rather than Lava Bombs. The Remedy bombs will attach a tether to a Grey bomb and slowly move toward it. Hitting the Remedy bombs will push them away, allowing time for the Grey bombs to be killed.LootSee also:Ilvl 185 Dungeon ArmorandIlvl 185 Dungeon AccessoriesGhrah Luminary5Allagan Tomestone of
