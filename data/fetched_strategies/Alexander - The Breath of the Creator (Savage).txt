Players will note that the floor has three buttons, one in the north, the center and the south. The boss will periodically jump to these traps to add a specific mechanic to the fight.North Trap: Ice turrets fire on both edges of the arena.Middle Trap: Two huge wrecking balls will fall from the ceiling and smash into the ground at the center of the arena.South Trap: Spikes will come up out of the floor, stunning all players and locking them into place for 5 seconds and inflict aBleeddebuff.Players can activate these traps as well as the boss, so be careful when navigating the arena.The boss has another reoccurring mechanic throughout the fight,Chargeattacks. These come out in either single, double or triple charges and will show an indicator as to what attack is coming out at the end of the cast:Critical Wrath: Blue and white circle with lines moving outwards from the circle. Players will need to spread out to avoid this attack.Bomb Toss: Orange circle with lines moving inwards. Furthest player away will have a bomb dropped on them. Players need to stack to mitigate damage.Gobswipe Conklops: Green circle. This is a donut AoE so move into the boss's hitbox.Gobspin Whooshdrops: Red circle with a triangle in the center. This is a point-blank AoE, so players need to move out.These attacks can come out in any order, so players need to pay attention to the markers.Phase 1Goblin Rush: Three hit attack on the primary target, deals mid-range damage.Gobrush Rush Gob: Three hit tankbuster on the primary target. Tanks will need to use cooldowns to survive.Gobsway Rumblerocks: High raid-wide damage. Mitigate and heal through.Single Charge: The indicator will tell players how to move. it will either be a move in or move out mechanic.Trap: The boss will jump to one of the traps. The first trap is always the spike trap.Single Charge: This will be the opposite of the previous attack. Players will still be stuck in place due to the spikes, so be sure to move prior to the attack.Gobslash Slicetops: The main tank will receive aPreymarker and tether to the boss. The off tank will either need toProvokethe boss so the main tank can run away and break the tether, or the main tank can simply use an invulnerability skill. players should avoid being in front of the boss during this attack, as the attack fires out from the boss and will kill anyone it hits. The boss will follow up with anotherGobrush Rush Gob, so healers should be ready for this.Phase 2Trap: This trap will be the ice turret trap. The boss will useDischargeto cover the center of the room in AoEs, forcing players to stand at the edge of the arena. The AoEs will resolve just before the trap fires, so players can move in to the center to avoid the turrets.Gobsnick Leghops: The boss will summon clones around the arena and debuff players withExtreme Caution. This debuff requires players to stop attacking the boss until it resolves. This includes auto-attacks, so sheath your weapon. If players do attack the boss, they will be killed. After the debuff wears off the clones will leave, and players can attack the boss again.The boss will leap to a random spot on the arena and castSingle Charge, and it will be the donut AoE, so follow the boss in. A clone will also spawn where the boss was standing that the off tank should grab.
AfterSingle Chargegoes off, be sure to separate the boss and the ad, as they will tether together and buff each other withDamage Up.
The clone will castGobswish Spraymops, a massive AoE with a small safe zone behind the boss. Players should focus on defeating the clone quickly, then return to the boss.Trap: The boss will summon the wrecking balls this time while castingDischargeand marking the edges of the arena with AoEs, forcing players to stand under where the wrecking balls will land. The AoEs on the edges will detonate after the balls land however, so players can stand in them, then move to the safe zones just before they explode.Double Charge: This set of charges will be the move in and move out mechanics, however they will be in a random order, so players will need to pay attention to see what attacks coming out.The boss will leap to another random location and either castSingle ChargeorGobsnick Leghops. The boss will change tactics at 60% HP.Phase 3The boss will leap to one end of the arena and summon theGobPressR-VIat the other end. This ad will slowly make its way across the arena viaSteamroller, which will let it charge forward a short way. If a player is hit by this, they will die. The traps on the floor are inactive during this time, so players can move freely. Healers will be marked withBrighteyes, causing fire puddles to drop beneath them and debuffing them withMagic Vulnerability Up, preventing them from being able to take another puddle. Therefore, they must pass their prey markers to other players. The boss will also castIlluminati Handcanon, players simply need to step out of these AoEs as needed, andGobsway Rumblerocks, so healers will be on high alert during this. 
Players need to kill the ad before they run out of room. Once they do, the boss will be targetable once again.Phase 4The boss will begin the phase withGoblin Rushand Gobrush Rush Gob.Triple Charge: This attack has two patterns:Out, Spread, InorIn, Out, Stack. Players will need to watch the indicators to know how to move.The boss will leap away once more and leave behind another clone, and useSingle Chargeagain. Handle this the same way as last time, pull the ad away and burn it down.Gobspin Zoomdrops: The boss tethers to a player, begins to spin and slowly advances towards them. Anyone hit by this attack will be knocked back and and take heavy damage. The boss can only be knocked out of this state by the Ice turrets, so have the main tank take the tether and lead the boss towards the edge of the arena, and have the assigned player activate the trap. The boss will stop this attack and be attackable again.Gobsplice Mooncrops: High damage and knockback into the sides of the arena. Players will need to activate the spike trap to not take the effects of the knockback.The boss will leap across the arena and use eitherSingle ChargeorGobsnick Leghops.
at 30%, the boss will summon chainsaws from the walls that shoot across the arena in a straight line, dividing the platform into 3 sections. These deal heavy damage and knockback, so be sure to stand in the safe spaces between them. The boss will useIlluminati HandcannonandBrighteyes, so dodge AoEs and pass prey markers accordingly. The boss will use anotherSingle Chargewith a point-blank AoE, so move to the other edge of the arena. The wall saws will recede at this point. The boss will use anotherBrighteyesandGobslash Slicetops, then activate the Ice turrets and Wrecking ball traps one after the other. These can be handled the exact same way as before.
At this point, three ads will spawn, 1Hedgeknightand 2Goblin of Fortune. These ads are buffed with a very strongVulnerability Downand will enrage and wipe the raid in 30 seconds. Players need to hit the ads with the wrecking ball trap to remove their buff, then burn them down as quickly as possible. The boss will castGobsway Rumblerocksthroughout this time.
The boss will summon the wall saws once again, so be sure to avoid them once again. The boss will cast aTriple Chargewith three random attacks.
