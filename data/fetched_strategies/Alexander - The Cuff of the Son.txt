Although there is certainly more to the apparent treachery than meets the eye, there is no time for doubt. Your offensive against the Illuminati must continue!— In-game descriptionAlexander - The Cuff of the Sonis a level 60raidintroduced inpatch 3.2withHeavensward.

However, these must all be defeated to proceed.This is one of the very few normal-difficulty duties where a tank swap is recommended to safely resolve some mechanics.BlasterBlaster drops mines which can and should be avoided (tank may have to move the boss depending on the placement)Players will then be marked and have copies of Blaster fall on them.Spread out to avoid overlapping damage.Try to spread out in a line to make it easier to deal withThe copies will charge in the direction they are facing after a short delayIf tagged, you will take damage and receive aVulnerability Updebuff.Tanks don't have to swap.BrawlerTank should face the boss away while everyone else stacks right behind it.Brawler has three different attacks. Look at the hands to figure out which is coming.Single drillSingle laser (one arm equipped)Double laser (both arms equipped)Single drilltargets a random player with a proximity line AoE.If there's asingle laser, the tank can soak this by themselves with mitigationIf it's adouble laser, the tank should join the group and split the damage.Note that lethal damage from the lasers will bypass tank invulnerabilities.Tanks should swap after 3-4 stacks of theMagic Vulnerability Updebuff.SwindlerThere is a debuff placed on everyone based on an altitude (high or low).The floor panels will raise and lower to deal with this mechanic. The raised panels will glow red.Go to the elevation opposite of the debuff received. (If you get the high debuff (purple), go to the lower panels. If you get the low debuff (red), go to the higher panels. You can also tell which debuff the size of the rings around you after the initiation).Choosing the wrong elevation will cause you to take substantial damage and receive aVulnerability UpdebuffThere will be unavoidable AOE damage afterwards.The number of orbs above the targeted person indicates the number of people who need to be in the ring to split the damage in order to nullify it.Tanks don't have to swap unless you get theVulnerability Updebuff by being on the wrong elevation.VortexerA player will be marked with a blue indicator around themLava pools will spawnVortexer will use a knockbackThe marked player will summon a water sprite where they are standingPlayers will then deal with the Shiva ice ringsAt least one player needs to use these rings to freeze the water.Vortexer will use a knockbackEveryone will need to hide behind the newly created ice boulder to avoid being wiped to Vortexer's Ultra Flash.Tanks will need to swap after (2) stacks of theVulnerability Updebuff.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Midan LensOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan PedalOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Midan CrankOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan SpringOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan PedalOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan BoltOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Midas II10Discover every location withinAlexander: Midas - the Cuff of the Son.-3.2TriviaThe four bosses in this raid are a reference to theCombaticonsfrom the Transformers:  Blaster (Blast Off), Brawler (Brawl), Swindler (Swindle), and Vortexer (Vortex).
