Casting its shadow over the Dravanian forelands, this towering peak is revered by the dragons as both holy ground and resting place. And now, in accordance with your pact, Vidofnir has thrown open to you the final ascent to the sacred mount's summit. But Nidhogg's minions will not lightly suffer this intrusion. Ere you gaze upon the fabled expanse of the Churning Mists, you must first carve a path through the mountain's denizens and overcome the consort of Nidhogg, herself─the she-dragon, Tioman.— In-game descriptionSohm Alis a level 53dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.0withHeavensward.

Dialogue Infographic Part 3LoreThe Promised RestThe shadow of this towering giant ever fills over the Dravanian forelands. A colossal lode of crystal concealed beneath its rocky skin, the upper bulk of Sohm Al has torn free to become a majestic floating island. Though physically separate, a stream of aether chains the peak in place, and thus, along with its grounded base, is the landform in its entirety considered the highest mountain in all of Eorzea.Since ancient times, the dragons have revered Sohm Al as a holy site and resting place. Indeed, the name itself means “promised rest,” for when a dragon senses that its end is near, it will seek out the mountain’s slopes, there to quietly await the approach of death. As such, mortal intrusion is unwelcome at best, and, as was the case with the Warrior of Lights ascent during the Dragonsong War, at worst draws the hostile attentions of Nidhogg’s Horde.TiomanThe consort of the dread wyrm Nidhogg, Tioman guarded against intruders Upon the sacred mountain from her perch atop the eternal vigil Hess Af. Her death at the hands of the Warrior of Light is thought to have given even the mighty Nidhogg pause in his plans for vengeance.Protecting The Holy LandThe fall of Nidhogg brought an end not only to the Dragonsong War, but also to the hierarchy of power that reigned upon Sohm Al. Bereft of its dreaded leader, the Horde scattered to the four winds, leaving the dragons' sacred grounds untended and unguarded. All manner of beastly intruders soon arrived, irresistibly drawn by the energies of bountiful crystal lodes. With none to quash this infestation, Sohm Al's paths became ever more wild and dangerous. And even as the mountain was being overrun, Vidofnir, white dragon of Hraesvelgr’s brood, was alerted to the stirrings of its volcanic core. She vowed to hunt down the pests without, but as her bulk was too great to enter the narrow passages within, this investigation she entrusted to the party of the Warrior of Light. That such a request might be made was proof that the rift betwixt man and dragon had already begun to mend.Lava ScorpionA creature of living lava, this baking nightmare rose in the pool of magma hidden within the heart of Sohm Al when the dragons were no longer present, kept the scorpion in check the ancient menace resurfaced and began agitating the mountain's volcanic core with its wild thrashing.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
