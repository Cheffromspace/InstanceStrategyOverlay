ImportantThe North American and European data centers primarily useParty Finderto challenge (Extreme) content. Using Duty Finder to match with random players is not recommended and will be more difficult than pre-forming a party. For an easy completion (that will satisfy any quest requirements) or loot farming, it is recommended that players use Party Finder and form anUnrestricted Party(i.e., with level sync disabled). Players who wish to complete this duty with level sync enabled should also form a pre-made party, which also enables the use ofMinimum Item LevelandSilence Echosettings for a more authentic challenge compared to a Duty Finder party.This article is about the level 70 challenge-modetrial.

Duly inspired by your account of the battle forByakko's soul, he tries his hand at one such "tanka", seeking to capture the essence of who the auspice truly is. Even absent music, his words nevertheless have a hypnotic feeling, and you find it rather easy to recall the encounter, albeit in a more dramatic fashion...— In-game descriptionThe Jade Stoa (Extreme)is a level 70trialintroduced inpatch 4.2withStormblood.Contents1Strategy1.1Auspice: Byakko1.2Phase 11.3Free-Fall Transition1.4Phase 22Loot2.1Treasure Coffer3Achievements4ImagesStrategyAuspice:ByakkoPlayers will enter a circular arena and witness Byakko's transformation from a White Tiger into a more humanoid form. Bear in mind that the outer edges of the arena during the first and second phase are entirely safe. However, this does not apply during the transitionalFree-Fall Phasein-between.Phase 1Storm Pulse- an unavoidable raid-wide AoE to keep healers on their toes.Heavenly Strike- a vicious tankbuster against Byakko's main target which should be mitigated via defensive cooldowns.State of Shock- a two-part mechanic where Byakko will physically hoist his main target into the air, rendering them unable to act. Simultaneously, a stack-marker will form on the opposite side of the arena - the location where Byakko will slam the grabbed target. Participants should move to the stack marker to help absorb incoming damage. If not absorbed, the slammed target (typically the main-tank) will take a fatal blow.State of Shockwill inflict vulnerability stacks on both the slammed target and those who share the damage. It will also be executed twice in a row.NOTE: Due to the vulnerability debuff placed on the slammed target and those who share the damage, and the fact that this mechanic will happen twice in a row, the raid should split into two groups, one for each slam. Also, the off-tank should Provoke Byakko during the first grab so that they will take the second slam. If one tank takes both slams, or if people absorb more than one slam, results are typically fatal.Unrelenting Anguish- after moving to the centre of the arena, Byakko will begin firing a spiral of large red orbs from himself that will travel to the arena edges. Players must make every effort to avoid colliding with these orbs. At the same time, a tank, healer and damage-dealer will be marked withOminous Wind, a debuff that will explode if two (or more) players with the debuff move close to each other.Fire & Lightning- after targeting a random player, this massive column AoE will be charged up and fired from Byakko during the aboveUnrelenting Anguishmechanic (and various other moments during the battle). To avoid, move out of the large red telegraph as quickly as possible.Hakutei (Tiger)- Byakko will unleash the White Tiger from his arm into the centre of the arena, requiring the off-tank to pick it up as soon as possible and turn it away from the party. This add is capable of a devastating cleave attack against everyone directly in front of it. While burning the add down as soon as possible, participants must also be ready to deal withAramata.Aramata- Byakko marks two random players who will eventually drop a vicious AoE puddle on the ground at their location after a brief delay (three times in a row). These puddles will inflict a devastating bleed on anyone who collides with them. Those marked by Aramata should move as far away from the group as possible (preferably to the outer edge of the arena) and drop all three puddles in a manner that won't inconvenience the party.Storm Pulsewill once again be cast during the above overlap; thus healers must be ready to heal or help mitigate unavoidable AoE damage while the group focuses on burning down the White Tiger add.Distant Clap- a doughnut AoE that is cast at Byakko's hitbox, requiring players to either move to the opposite end of the arena or into Byakko himself to avoid damage. Simultaneously, the White Tiger will leap into the air and mark its main target with a vicious proximity tank buster, forcing them to move away from the group to avoid damaging them. As a result, the tank controlling the add should move to the outer edge of the arena (opposite of Byakko) while the rest move into Byakko.Fire & Lightningwill be cast once more (column AoE), followed by an additionalStorm Pulse(unavoidable AoE).Roar of Thunder- an unavoidable AoE that deals damage based on the amount of health the White Tiger has remaining. If insufficient damage has been inflicted to it by the time it is fully cast, the raid may suffer a wipe. The White Tiger will begin charging this after Byakko exits the arena, along with an additional mechanic,Aramata Orbs.Aramata Orbs- forms large orbs at the outer edges of the arena that will slowly move towards the centre. If they collide with the White Tiger, it'll be healed. Seeing as it is charging up an AoE attack based on its total health, the group must run through these orbs to pop them before they reach the centre.NOTE: Before the release of Shadowbringers, poppingAramata Orbsused to stealTPfrom the player. Due to Healers having no use forTPat the time, the normal strategy was to have either (or both) healers pop all the orbs themselves. However,TPno longer exists. The Orbs now inflict a debuff reducing physical damage dealt for a few seconds so the strategy still appliesShould you survive the oncomingRoar of Thunder, the next phase will begin with Byakko launching the entire raid into the air for a free-fall mini-phase.Free-Fall TransitionAfter being launched into the air, the raid will begin free-falling. No actions (e.g. attacks or healing) can be performed at this time. During the phase, the outer ring of the arena will kill any player who touches it. Additionally, Byakko will begin firing orbs from far below which players must avoid. Periodically, Byakko will leap up and cast a doughnut AoE which must be avoided by moving into the centre. Lastly, Hakutei (the White Tiger) will occasionally cast a straight line AoE through the centre, forcing players to move out.Should you survive the onslaught, the raid will land (stunned) in a new arena be blasted with a massive unavoidable AoE attack from Byakko, killing any player who took too much damage during the free-fall.Phase 2Heavenly Strike- the phase immediately begins with a vicious tank buster against the main target.Hundredfold Havoc- a set of outward-firing AoE lightning patterns that are telegraphed by an arrow icon, displaying the direction they will travel from Byakko (arena centre). Two patterns will be fired simultaneously (the second being slightly delayed), giving players enough time for the first pattern to fire outward so that they can move into the now safe area to avoid the delayed pattern.State of Shockwill be cast at the near-end of the previous mechanic (identical to the first in phase 1). The off-tank should be ready to provoke Byakko after it grabs the main-tank, while the group split up and prepare to soak the two upcoming slams.Sweep Of The Leg- a massive frontal-cone AoE that Byakko will cast after everyState of Shockduring phase 2. Unlike normal mode, this will not have any telegraph whatsoever; thus players must be ready to stand behind Byakko after the double-slams to avoid being round-house kicked into oblivion. After executing this move, Byakko will leap into the centre of the arena.Unrelenting Anguish- similar to the version in phase 1, except now, a tank, healer and damage-dealer will be marked withGale Force, a large AoE marker that will drop a slowly expanding puddle at their location after a brief delay. Should any of these puddles collide with another puddle, the raid will wipe, forcing the group to position these puddles as far away from each other as possible (all while avoiding Orbs of Anguish).NOTE: After droppingGale Force, a tank, healer and damage-dealer will once again be marked byOminous Windwhich must be dealt with in the same manner as Phase 1. Marked players should avoid approaching any other player with the debuff as failure to do so will cause the debuffs to explode.Fire & Lightningwill be cast from the edge of the arena while players are dodgingAnguish OrbsandGale Force Puddles. If the Gale Force puddles have been appropriately placed, players can quickly move to a safe spot between them to avoid the last remaining Anguish Orbs and the oncoming column AoE.NOTE: From this point onward, a collective set of previously seen mechanics will be executed in sequence. Assuming the group survives the ordeal, Byakko will enter a mechanical loop.Hakutei (Tiger)- similar to phase 1, the off-tank will need to pick up the White Tiger while the main-tank pulls Byakko to the outer edges. The mechanics are identical (with a few extra overlaps), such asFire & Lightning(column AoE),Distant Clap(doughnut AoE from Byakko), the proximity marker on the off-tank, andHeavenly Strike(tank buster).Roar of Thunderwill be cast after the above string of mechanics, causing the White Tiger to jump into the centre and begin charging an unavoidable AoE with the damage based on its current health (just like phase 1, including the presence ofAramata Orbs). Additionally, the group will have to deal with mechanics from Byakko, such asStorm Pulse, while dealing with this slightly stricter DPS check.Fire & Lightningwill be cast shortly afterwards, followed by twoStorm Pulsecasts back-to-back.NOTE: Some groups may choose to use a Limit Break 3 (Tank) to absorb theRoar of Thunderinstead of damaging the White Tiger. This is a good option if the group is concerned over the 12minute enrage timer, or to finish off Byakko if his health is low.Hundredfold Havocwill be cast once more, except now it will stack withGale Force(puddles) which should be placed the same way as they were before. Remember, should a puddle collide with another, the raid will wipe.State of Shockwill be used once more, forcing a tank-swap and group-split to absorb the incoming slams while theGale Forcepuddles expand. Bear in mind thatSweep The Legwill be cast after the double-slam with no telegraph. Once Byakko has slammed both tanks, be sure to move behind him to avoid his vicious round-house kick.NOTE: Byakko will now combo various mechanics on a loop (such asUnrelenting AnguishandGale Force) until he is defeated or he hits the enrage timer (12 minutes). Should the fight go on for that long, he will repeatedly castStorm Pulsethree times before charging up a forced raid-wipe with a fourth cast.LootSee also:Byakko's WeaponsEach player will receive 1Byakko Totemper kill.
