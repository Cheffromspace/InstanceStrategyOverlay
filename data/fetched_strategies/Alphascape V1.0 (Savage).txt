It is possible to fall over the edge during battles, though victims can be raised after a moderate delay if they perish in this manner. There are twoElemental Phase's that will change depending on which ability Chaos uses after the opening tankbuster, giving the fight a small element of RNG, but nothing overly complex.If Chaos opens the fight withDamning Edict, the first elemental phase will involveInfernofollowed byCyclone. If Chaos usesLongitudinal & Latitudinal Implosion, then the first elemental phase will involveTsunamiandEarthquake. All players should keep an eye on whether Chaos usesDamning EdictorLongitudinal & Latitudinal Implosionat the beginning of the fight as that will allow the group to predict the flow of battle.The fight is split into four notable segments:First Phase:Two elemental attacks - determined by which opening ability he used first (see above).Second Phase:Chaos Orb.Third Phase:Two elemental attacks - whichever didn't happen the first time (see above).Final Phase:Enrage.Another notable difference between normal and savage difficulty is the inclusion of four new debuffs forCycloneandEarthquake.General MechanicsLatitudinal ImplosionandLongitudinal Implosion- Chaos prepares to unleash an AoE attack across the platform in two directions (either from the sides or from the front and rear), shortly followed by additional blasts in the two remaining directions. Unlike normal mode, both versions will have no telegraph and will also applyMagic Vulnerability Upto anyone hit, making repeated failures fatal.Remember:If Chaos opens withLatitudinal ImplosionorLongitudinal Implosion, the first elemental phase will involveTsunamiandEarthquakeWhen Chaos is castingLatitudinal Implosion, players must first avoid 90-degree cones that fire from both sides of the boss, then a follow-up blast from the front and rear.When Chaos is castingLongitudinal Implosion, the reverse applies. Players must first avoid 90-degree cones that fire from the front and rear of the boss, then a follow-up blast from its sides.Damning Edict- causes Chaos to prepare a massive 180-degree frontal attack. Unlike normal mode,Damning Edicthas no telegraph whatsoever. Whenever you noticeDamning Edictbeing cast, all players should move behind Chaos as soon as possible.Remember:If Chaos opens with this move, the first elemental phase will involveInfernoandCyclone.Now that you know which abilities lead to which phases, we'll cover other generic mechanics Chaos will utilize in-between them, then describe each elemental phase individually.Non-Elemental Attack Specific MovesChaotic Dispersion- a vicious tankbuster, depicted by Chaos pulling back his arm and unleashing a vicious swipe against his main target. Be sure to utilize mitigation CDs if necessary. In savage mode,Chaotic Dispersionwill inflictPhysical Vulnerability Up, which requires a tank-swap.Umbra Smash- creates a proximity marker within the arena - the furthest point from where Chaos is currently positioned. After a brief delay, Chaos will the leap to the marked area and deal damage to the entire raid based on how close players were to the point of impact.Umbra Smashcan be seen duringTsunamiandCyclonephases and is generally followed byDamning Edict, forcing the entire raid to run behind Chaos as soon as possible.Fiendish Orbs- creates two orbs within the arena duringCycloneandTsunamiphases that will tether to a player each. After a delay, both orbs will inflict damage to the tethered players. DuringFiendish Orbs, the tether can be passed to (or picked up by) a different player by intercepting the tether line. As a result, the tank and off-tank should grab these tethers whenever possible and mitigate the damage.Dancing Orbs- creates four orbs at intercardinal positions of the safe area during theInfernoandEarthquakephases which will shoot straight-line AoEs towards random players.Knock Down (Generic)- marks four players (specifically tanks and healers) with a stack marker. By stacking with at least one player,Knock Downwill deal moderate damage and applyMagic Vulnerability Up. If the stack is taken alone, it will instead deal very heavy damage and stun the player. Bear in mind that the location(s) whereKnock Downhas concluded will be the target location forBig Bangfollow-ups (see below).Knock Down (Tsunami and Cyclone)- targets two players (healers specifically) with a proximity marker. The attack deals more damage the closer you are to the player with the marker. Just like the other version, the location(s) whereKnock Downhas concluded will be the target location forBig Bangfollow-ups (see below).Big Bang- a broad circle AoE that explodes whereverKnock Downattacks have concluded (with no telegraphs). As such, all players should be mindful of where anyKnock Downmechanics were handled and avoid those areas untilBig Banghas detonated. If any player is hit by aBig Bangblast, they will suffer major damage and be knocked up into the air. Also, theTsunamiandCycloneversions ofBig Bangare much larger than theInfernoandEarthquakevariants.Inferno PhaseInferno- inflicts unavoidable raidwide damage and blasts the arena with fire damage, spawning a single safe spot in the center of the arena in the shape of a circle. All players must remain within the safe area for the duration ofInfernoto avoidBurnsand sustained damage. All players will be afflicted byEntropyany timeInfernohas been cast.Entropy- applies a debuff to all players that will explode on expiration, dealing moderate damage and knocking back anyone near the exploding player.Entropyon the tanks and healers will have a 10-second duration, whereas all DPS will have a 24-second duration. As a result, all tanks and healers should stand to the north, south, east, and west of the boss (at the very edges of the safe zone) seeing as their debuffs will expire first, allowing the DPS to huddle within the bosses hitbox. This allowsEntropyto detonate on the tanks and healers without colliding with other players. Later on, all DPS will need to do the same once their debuffs are near expiration, giving the already exploded tanks and healers the ability to huddle within the boss.However, beforeEntropyexplodes on the tanks and healers, Chaos will unleashLatitudinal ImplosionandLongitudinal Implosion's, forcing the entire raid to avoid the front and back of Chaos (then the sides), or avoid his sides (then the front and back), depending on which version is cast. Once both implosions have been avoided, tanks and healers should move to their assigned positions seeing as theirEntropydebuffs will soon expire.Chaotic Dispersion- a vicious tankbuster (seeGeneral Mechanicsabove for an explanation). At this point, it won't be long beforeEntropyon the damage dealers explodes, so make sure everyone has moved to their assigned positions to avoid overlap.Inferno- another blast of unavoidable raidwide damage that will re-cast a new wave ofEntropydebuffs to all party members (with the same duration as before). Once again, all tanks and healers should position to the North, South, East and West edges whilst the damage dealers huddle in the center.From here, the tanks and healers will once again need to detonate at their assigned safespots while the DPS huddle in the center. Once detonated, Chaos will unleashKnock Down(seeGeneral Mechanics) upon the tanks and healers, targeting them with stack markers than will each need to be soaked by at least one other player each. Remember, allKnock Downmechanics throughout the battle will always be followed by an eventualBig Bang, a massive AoE that detonates at every location whereKnock Downhas concluded, but not before allEntropydebuffs have concluded.To combat the overlapping mechanics, previously exploded (Entropy) tanks and healers will need one DPS each to help soak the stack marker at the four assigned safespots at cardinal or intercardinal positions. Once done, tanks and healers can collapse into the center of the arena while the damage dealers remain in the safespots to allowEntropyto detonate. Once done, all players should move into the center to avoidBig Bang, which will detonate at all locations where the previous stack mark mechanics were resolved.Dancing Orbs- creates four orbs at intercardinal positions of the safe area during theInfernoandEarthquakephases which will shoot straight-line AoEs towards random players.OnceDancing Orbshas concluded, the elemental phase will cease, returning the arena to its normal state.Here's a quick run-down of the mechanical timeline once more:Inferno- raidwide damage that appliesEntropy.Tanks & healers (Entropy) explodes.Latitudinal & Longitudinal Implosion.DPS (Entropy) explodes.Chaotic Dispersion- tankbuster.Inferno- raidwide damage that re-appliesEntropyonce again.Tanks & healers (Entropy) explodes.Tanks & healers targeted with stack marker forKnock Down.DPS (Entropy) explodes.Big Bangexplodes.Dancing Orbsappear and begin to shoot straight-line AoEs towards players.Cyclone Phase (always follows theInfernoPhase)Cyclone- inflicts unavoidable raidwide damage and appliesHeadwinddebuffs to each tank and healer, as well asTailwinddebuffs to all DPS. Also, a large purple circle will be formed in the very center of the arena that will eventually turn into a raging cyclone. Anyone who walks (or is displaced) into the cyclone at any point will receive a nastyWindburndebuff.Headwind (Debuff)- applied to all tanks and healers. "A strong wind blows towards the face of your character". Players withHeadwindshould face away from the cyclone.Tailwind (Debuff)- applied to all DPS. "A strong wind blows towards the back of your character". Players withTailwindshould face towards the cyclone.If either debuff should expire normally, the affected player will suffer tremendous damage, a huge knock-up, and aDamage Downdebuff. In response, players can cleanse their debuffs by being knocked-back by specific mechanics - the distance of which is determined by the type of debuff and the direction the affected player is facing at the time (see above). Due to knock-backs being required to cleanse debuffs, utilizing knock-back immunity cooldowns is highly discouraged at this time.Once all debuffs have been applied, the raid will need to contend withUmbra Smash(seeGeneral Mechanics), followed byDamning Edictonce Chaos has landed.Damning Edictwill always be cast towards the central cyclone, leaving a very small safe area directly behind Chaos. Rather than running behind Chaos to avoidDamning Edict, players will need to allow themselves to be knocked-back byTornado- a telegraphed knock-back from the central circle which will cleanse players of theirHead/Tailwinddebuff. However, depending on the debuff, players will either need to face the cyclone (Tailwind) or face away from it (Headwind) to be knocked a safe distance. If players face the wrong direction during theTornadoknock-back, they will be launched off the platform to their doom.Once done,Chaotic Dispersion(tankbuster) will be followed by a re-cast ofCyclone, inflicting raidwide damage and re-applying allHeadwindandTailwinddebuffs with the same duration and targeting as before. Once re-applied, Chaos will castKnock Down- a version specific toTsunamiandCyclonephases (seeGeneral Mechanics), but will still be followed byBig Bang.Once both healers have been marked forKnock Down, anotherTornado(arena-wide knock-back) will trigger. Once again, the entire raid will need to position themselves so that they are not knocked off the platform, remembering to face towards (or away from) the cyclone depending on their debuff. Meanwhile, both healers will need to run to opposite corners of the arena (away from the raid) and stand with their back to the cyclone due toHeadwind, allowing themselves to be safely pushed into the corners. By doing so, they will be a safe distance apart forKnock Downto deal minimal damage to themselves and the raid. Don't forget -Big Bangwill detonate wherever the healers resolvedKnock Down, thus both will need to run back towards the raid away from theBig Bangblast arena.Chaos will now summon twoFiendish Orbswithin the arena that will each tether to a different player (seeGeneral Mechanics). Both the tank and off-tank should grab the tethers as soon as possible and mitigate the upcoming damage. If desperate, immunity cooldowns can also be considered here.OnceFiendish Orbshas concluded, the elemental phase will cease, returning the arena to its normal state.Here's a quick run-down of the mechanical timeline once more:Cyclone- raidwide damage, applyingHeadwindandTailwinddebuffs.Umbra Smash- Chaos leaps to the corner furthest away from where he is currently positioned.Damning Edict+Tornado- forces all players to position themselves so that they are pushed behind Chaos, remembering to face towards, or away from, the tornado depending on their debuff.Chaotic Dispersion- a vicious tankbuster, forcing a tank-swap.Cyclone- more raidwide damage that re-appliesHead/Tailwinddebuffs.Knock Down- marks both healers withProximity Markers.Tornado- all players must once again position themselves for a knockback, remembering theirHead/Tailwinddebuff. Healers will need to do so away from the rest of the raid, then run to avoidBig Bang.Fiendish Orbs- tank and off-tank grab both tethers and mitigate upcoming damage.Tsunami PhaseTsunami- inflicts unavoidable raidwide damage and appliesDynamic Fluiddebuffs to all players. Also, two columns of water will form at the sides of the arena, leaving only a vertical stripe through the centre as a safe area. Anyone who walks (or is displaced) into the watery areas at any point will sufferDropsy.Dynamic Fluid- applies a 10-second duration debuff on tanks and healers, and a 17-second duration version on DPS. WheneverDynamic Fluidexpires on a player, a large donut AoE will detonate around them, slaying anyone caught in the blast. As a rule of thumb, stacking on top of one another will prevent cleaving members of the group.OnceDynamic Fluidhas been applied, Chaos will unleashUmbra Smash(seeGeneral Mechanics) followed byDamning Edict, forcing players to get behind Chaos as soon as possible. Beforehand, however, the tank and healer variants ofDynamic Fluidwill detonate. As a rule of thumb, players should stay in the same spot until the donut AoEs have detonated, then move as a group behind Chaos to avoidDamning Edict. By the time the group reaches the safe area, the second set ofDynamic Fluiddebuffs will detonate. As long as the group remains stacked together, nobody will be cleaved. Once concluded, Chaos will smash the primary target withChaotic Dispersion(tankbuster), forcing a tank-swap, then bombard the raid with another cast ofTsunami, inflicting raidwide damage and re-applyingDynamic Fluidwith the same targeting and durations as before.Knock Down- targets both healers with proximity markers (just like theCyclonephase), forcing them to move away from each other (and the rest of the group). As such, one healer should head to the north while the other heads to the south, leaving the rest of the raid in the center. Seeing as one set ofDynamic Fluiddebuffs are detonating at the same time, anyone not positioned in time may be cleaved by a donut AoE and slain outright. As usual,Big Bangwill eventually detonate where bothKnock Downmechanics were resolved, forcing the healers to return to the arena center to order to avoid the upcoming explosions. The second set ofDynamic Fluiddebuffs will explode at the same time, thus time is of the essence, as anyone not stacked in the center at this point is very likely to be hit byBig Bangor a donut AoE.Chaos will now summon twoFiendish Orbsto the north and south that will each tether to a different player (seeGeneral Mechanics). Both the tank and off-tank should grab the tethers as soon as possible and mitigate the upcoming damage. If desperate, immunity cooldowns can also be considered here.OnceFiendish Orbshave concluded, the elemental phase will cease, returning the arena to its normal state.Here's a quick run-down of the mechanical timeline once more:Tsunami- deals raidwide damage and appliesDynamic Fluidto everyone in the raid.Umbra Smash+Dynamic Fluid- Chaos leaps to the north or south based on which side he is further away from. The timing ofUmbra Smashaligns with the first set ofDynamic FluidAoEs.Damning Edict+Dynamic Fluid- leaves a vary small safe space behind Chaos on the edge of the arena, followed by the remainingDynamic Fluiddebuffs detonating.Chaotic Dispersion- a vicious tankbuster, forcing a tank-swap.Tsunami- more raidwide damage and a new set ofDynamic Fluiddebuffs.Knock Down+Dynamic Fluid- healers targeted with proximity markers.Big Bang+Dynamic Fluid-Big Bangdetonates where bothKnock Downmechanics were resolved alongsideDynamic Fluiddonut AoEs.Fiendish Orbs- creates orbs at the north and south of the safe area.Earthquake Phase (always follows theTsunamiPhase)Earthquake- inflicts unavoidable raidwide damage and applies 20 second duration debuffs to all players -Accretionon tanks and healers,Primordial Cruston all DPS. The first cast ofEarthquakewill also render the southern side of the arena completely unsafe. Should any player walk (or be displaced into) the unsafe area will be affected withSludge.Accretion- a debuff applied to all tanks and healers with every cast ofEarthquakethat can be cleansed by healing the affected target(s) to full HP. If the debuff expires before being cleansed, the target will instantly be slain.Primordial Crusta debuff applied to all DPS with every cast ofEarthquakethat can only be cleansed by taking lethal damage from specific mechanics (which will instead leave their HP at 1). If the debuff expires before being cleansed appropriately, the target will be slain outright.Landslide- will eventually punt all players towards the southern (unsafe) area of the arena. To avoid, all players will need to stand at the very northern edge.After theLandslide(knock-back), Chaos will unleash aLatitudinalorLongitudinalcombination of implosions. Unlike other phases, the DPS will need to be hit by both blasts to take lethal damage andcleansetheirPrimordial Crustdebuffs (which will instead leave them with 1 HP rather than kill them), whereas the tanks and healers will need to avoid the attacks. OnceLat/Longimplosions have concluded, Chaos will prepare to smash the primary target with aChaotic Dispersion(tankbuster), forcing a tank-swap before the next wave of mechanics.From here, Chaos will unleash anotherEarthquake, inflicting massive raidwide damage and re-applying debuffs with the same duration and targeting as before. OnceEarthquakehas concluded, anotherLandslide(knockback) will commence, along with the generic version ofKnock Down(seeGeneral Mechanics), applying a stack marker to all tanks and healers, each requiring at least one other player to help soak the damage. Pairs of players (one marked and one unmarked) will need to spread out across the northern edge of the arena so that each marker is soaked appropriately (without overlapping) and so that nobody will be knocked into the unsafe area to the south. As soon as the knockback has concluded,Knock Downwill detonate.Don't forget that every cast ofKnock Downis always followed byBig Bang(AoE explosions) wherever theKnock Down's have resolved, thus all players (except DPS affected withPrimordial Crust) will need to be positioned near the northern side of the arena to avoid the eventual explosions. By taking lethal damage fromBig Bang, thePrimordial Crustdebuff will be removed, leaving the affected players at 1 HP instead of killing them.Dancing Orbs- creates four orbs around the safe portion of the arena area which will shoot straight-line AoEs towards random players.OnceDancing Orbshas concluded, the elemental phase will cease, returning the arena to its normal state.Here's a quick run-down of the mechanical timeline once more:Earthquake- massive raidwide damage that applies specific debuffs.Landslide- shoves players towards the southern half of the arena.Lat/Long Implosion- tanks and healers should avoid both blasts as normal, whereas DPS must intentionally "die" to cleansePrimordial Crust. Note that the initial hit will apply aMagic Vulnerability Up, ensuring that the second implosion will "kill" the player.Chaotic Dispersion- a vicious tankbuster, forcing a tank-swap.Earthquake- another wave of massive raidwide damage and debuffs.Landslide+Knock Down- tanks and healers receive stack markers that must be soaked by at least one other player each, forcing the raid to pair up and spread out from other pairs along the northern edge of the arena.Big Bang- detonates where allKnock Downmarkers were resolved. DPS withPrimordial Crustmust "die" to this, whereas all tanks and healers should retreat to the north to avoid the explosions.Dancing Orbs- shoots waves of straight-line AoEs at random players that everyone should avoid.Bowels of AgonyBowels of Agonyis a mid-phase interlude between the first and secondelemental phase. For example, if Chaos opens the fight withDamning Edict, the first elemental phase will involveInfernofollowed byCyclone. Once concluded,Bowels of Agonywill take place, which will then be followed by the remaining two elemental phases (TsunamiandEarthquake).Bowels of Agonybegins with all players being reduced to 1 HP and receiving specific debuffs depending on their role. All tanks and healers will be afflicted withHeadwindandDynamic Fluidsimultaneously, whereas DPS will be afflicted withEntropyandPrimordial Crustsimultaneously. Once debuffs have been applied, anOrb of Chaoswill spawn in the center of the arena, starting a DPS check (with Chaos himself being untargetable for the duration). If the crystal is not destroyed before the duty gauge reaches 100, the raid will suffer an unavoidable wipe.During the debuff overlap, all DPS will need to receive fatal damage due to theirPrimordial Crustdebuff. To achieve this, they must intentionally be cleaved by aDynamic Fluiddebuff detonation from a tank or healer. Meanwhile, tanks and healers will need to cleanse theirHeadwinddebuffs by suffering a knockback fromEntropy(DPS debuff). Due to beingHeadwind, they will also need to be looking away from the target knocking them back or they will suffer a much stronger knockback which may punt them off the platform.The desired result can be achieved by having each tank and healer pair with one damage dealer and have each pair stand at cardinal or intercardinal positions around the central crystal (like a "+" shape).Entropywill detonate first, knocking the paired tanks and healers away from the DPS and resolving theirHeadwinddebuffs. With that in mind, each tank and healer can them position themselves so that they cleave their assigned partner withDynamic Fluid, "killing" them (which resolves theirPrimordial Crustdebuff and instead leaves them at 1 HP).Assuming the raid survives (and destroys theOrb of Chaosbefore the timer hits 100),Soul of Chaoswill deal survivable raidwide damage. If the crystal has not been destroyed in time,Soul of Chaoswill instead result in a full team wipe.Once again,Bowels of Agonytakes place after the first two elemental phases. Succeeding here will result in Chaos entering the remaining two elemental phases. Once all four elemental phases have concluded, Chaos will enter anenragestate.Enrage PhaseHaving completed all four elemental phases, Chaos will leap to the middle of the arena and begin to cast all four elemental attacks in succession (Inferno,Cyclone,Tsunami,Earthquake), inflicting raidwide damage with each cast, as well as the debuffs associated with each elemental phase.Here's a quick run-down:Inferno- raidwide damage that appliesEntropyto all players (which will detonate at the same time).Tsunami- raidwide damage that appliesDynamic Fluidto all players (which will detonate at the same time).Cyclone- raidwide damage that appliesHead/Tailwindto all players (which will detonate at the same time). Seeing as there is no possible way to get knocked back (which normally resolvesHead/Tailwind), all players will suffer major damage, get knocked up into the air, and receive adamage downdebuff onceHead/Tailwindhas expired.Earthquake- raidwide damage that appliesAccretionto tanks and healers andPrimordial Crustto DPS. Seeing as no mechanics can provide fatal damage to cleansePrimordial Crust, they will be instantly slain once the debuffs expire. If Chaos hasn't been defeated by this point, tanks and healers can surviveAccretionby healing to max HP and attempt to finish off the boss themselves.Bowels of Agony- a hard enrage that inflicts an unavoidable wipe.Trivia"Inferno" used to be named "Blaze" untilPatch 5.4.Loot30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsAlphascape Datalog v1.0Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityOmega Earring Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Necklace Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Bracelet Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Ring Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityOmega Earring Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Necklace Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Bracelet Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Ring Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
