Imprisoned by the archbishop under suspicion of heresy, he now languishes in the gaol underneath the Vault. Yet all is not yet lost, for Lucia has hatched a bold plan to see justice done. While her party frees Ser Aymeric from captivity, you are to lead a party into the highest levels of the Vault and seize Thordan VII. Though the knights of the Heavens' Ward will attempt to bar your passage, you must press on, for the future of Ishgard hangs in the balance!— In-game descriptionThe Vaultis a level 57dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.0withHeavensward.

You can help the Final Fantasy XIV Wiki byexpanding it.Reason:Patch 6.2changesSer Adelphel uses a few moves. To begin with, he will have 3 adds with him, all of whom have extremely low health. When you've killed the others and gotten Adelphel around 30%, he will change forms, knocking everyone back and beginning the true encounter.When he casts Holy Shield Bash, he will target one player, jump to them, and perform a stun and hit combination.When he casts Holiest of Holy, he will deal moderate damage to every player in the room.At intervals, Adelphel will charge around the room, dealing damage and leaving behind orbs of light. These will deal damage to players upon exploding. When he is done charging, he will target one player and come crashing back down to them.Ser Grinnaux The BullThis key section of the article is incomplete. You can help the Final Fantasy XIV Wiki byexpanding it.Reason:Patch 6.2changesLike Ser Adelphel, Grinnaux first has a trivial health pool and will at one point change forms, knock everyone back, and unleash his full potential.Grinnaux has multiple ground pattern AOEs to watch out for.At regular intervals throughout the fight, Grinnaux will put down a Hyperdimensional Slash attack that lays out a red AOE before him in the direction of a random player. When this goes off, it will deal damage to anyone in its wake and leave an Aetherial Tear where it hits the wall of the room. This attack is always repeated twice in a row. Best strategy is to bait the Tears to the same general part of the wall so they aren't spread around; they will tether to and damage any player that gets too close to them. This is exacerbated by....After using his Slash attack to put out two Aetherial Tears, Grinnaux will use Faith Unmoving, a room-wide attack with a cast bar. This attack will push all players directly backward from Grinnaux. Make sure your back isn't to one of the Aetherial Tears; this is why it's beneficial to keep them all close together, so you have a safe place to get pushed back to. (Alternatively, you can use Arm's Length or Surecast to nullify the knockback.)Grinnaux will also put out a Dimensional Rift circle AOE that will damage players.Ser CharibertThis key section of the article is incomplete. You can help the Final Fantasy XIV Wiki byexpanding it.Reason:Patch 6.2changesSer Charibert does not have a phase switch like the other two; he starts out at full power.Charibert will do room-wide damage with Altar Pyre.Charibert will use a Holy Chain to chain two players together. Simply run away from each other to break this chain; otherwise you will take recurring damage.Charibert will cast Heavensflame and put out flame rings on the ground.At regular intervals, he'll summon a broken row of "knights." Like the mummies inThe Sunken Temple of Qarn (Hard), these will march across the room from wherever they spawn (they always spawn on the same side, though). Avoid being run over by these knights, as they will put Slow on you.At half health, Charibert will disappear for a moment. When he reappears, he will have a Dawn Knight and Dusk Knight with him, and summon several Holy Flames around the outside of the room. The Knights can safely be ignored; just make sure not to stand in their AOE attacks. Kill the Holy Flames quickly. After a short while, Charibert will cast a room-wide attack which deals more damage if any Holy Flames are left. After that, the normal rotation resumes, but now there will be two rows of knights and two sets of flame rings from Heavensflame.LootSee also:Halonic Weapons,Halonic ArmorandHalonic AccessoriesSer

FaithThe seat of Ishgard’s theocratic government, the Vault brings the administration of the church and the running of the state under one roof and one leader, the archbishop. Rising from the heart of the Pillars, the city’s upper level, it has long stood as the shining symbol of the nation.Ordinarily closed to the public, an exception is made during religious observances such as the Starlight Celebration, when citizens are granted entry to Saint Thordan’s Basilica, the church on the ground floor dedicated to the founding father. By special order, its doors were also opened to those who had been displaced by the fires that ravaged the Brume district.In contrast, but a privileged few outside the clergy have set foot on the upper levels. Accessible via lifts, the area is considered a holy sanctum, housing such facilities as church offices and prayer gardens, as well as the chambers of the archbishop himself. Situated above all of this, crowning the Vault—and indeed Ishgard—is the Hall of the Spear. Built in the image of the ice palace the Fury is said to have carved with Her spear, the temple sees use in official ceremonies such as the coronation of an archbishop.Ser Grinnaux the BullTransformed and empowered, Ser Grinnaux de Dzemael of the Heavens' Ward rose to challenge the Warrior of Light and his comrades, holding them at bay while the archbishop made his escape.Ser Charibert the SternNamed to the Heavens' Ward by virtue of his gift for pyromancy, Ser Charibert de Leusignac’s already formidable powers further burgeoned with his transformation. His abundance of arcane strength allowed him to simultaneously command the Vault’s automaton guardians against the Warrior of Light, but he nonetheless found himself overmatched and was forced to withdraw.Ser Adelphel BrightbladeA brother of the Heavens' Ward, Ser Adelphel de Chevraudan received of the primal King Thordan’s power and attained a stature to rival giants. Despite his additional bulk, the elegant swordsmanship for which he is famed was not diminished in the least.DialogueDuty Support DialogueAlphinaud:We must stop the archbishop before it's too late!Haurchefant:For friends and countrymen!Haurchefant:Here to delay us, no doubt.Alphinaud:There's no time.
