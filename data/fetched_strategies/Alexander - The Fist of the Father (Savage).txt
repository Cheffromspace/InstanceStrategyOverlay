Also known asA1S, it is the first sector ofAlexander: Gordias (Savage).Contents1Strategy1.1Oppressor and  Faust2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 2StrategyA1S GuideThis fight has a hard enrage of 8m30s, which means DPS will have to maximize activity. The boss has more health and more damage output than on normal mode, and his main damage abilities do a lot more damage and will require focused healing. The damage mitigation and healing requierment for this fight is very strict.OppressorandFaustThis key section of the article is incomplete. You can help the Final Fantasy XIV Wiki byexpanding it.Reason:The "Jump Phase" needs to be improved in this article, since it has different outcomes 3 times during the fight and multiple strategies can be applied.Resin Bombs:This drops bombs on a number of players, and will leave behind green puddles that deal a lot of damage as well as apply a strong Heavy debuff on players who stand in it. The strategy is to watch for this cast and move to areas where the puddles won't be in the way.Adds and Missiles:4 Adds will spawn, and 4 missiles will start dropping from above. The group will have to assign players to take each add, and will have to kill them under a specific missile. The player targeted by the add will gain a stacking debuff which will result in getting the debuff Mini if the stacks reaches 6 before it's killed.Hypercompressed Plasma:This is an attack that deals very heavy magical damage to the tanks, so they should have cooldowns up before, during, and after. Before and after each Hypercompressed Plasma, high raid damage takes place, healers need to be aware of this as the group and/or tanks will most likely fall to critical levels. Hypercompressed Plasma will not occure more than thrice per fight.Jump Phase:Both opressors will jump and after a while land on either adjacent or the same side of the platform, during this players will also drop a total of 8 resin bombs. One strategy for this is to stack in the middle, and when resin bombs start to drop make your way to a specified corner of the room. Don't run there immidietly however, as when resin bombs start dropping they drop over time. A good way to deal with  this it to run in zigzag patterns, to make sure all 8 resin bombs have dropped before reaching the stacking point.Loot15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsGordian Manifesto - Page 1Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityGordian Earrings of FendingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Earrings of SlayingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Earrings of AimingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Earrings of CastingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Earrings of HealingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of FendingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of SlayingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of AimingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of CastingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of HealingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of FendingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of SlayingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of AimingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of CastingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of HealingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Ring of FendingRing210CBlue1Gordian Ring of SlayingRing210CBlue1Gordian Ring of AimingRing210CBlue1Gordian Ring of CastingRing210CBlue1Gordian Ring of HealingRing210CBlue1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityGordian Earrings of FendingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Earrings of SlayingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Earrings of AimingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Earrings of CastingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Earrings of HealingEarrings210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of FendingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of SlayingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of AimingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of CastingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Neckband of HealingNecklace210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of FendingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of SlayingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of AimingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of CastingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Wristband of HealingBracelets210CBlue1Gordian Ring of FendingRing210CBlue1Gordian Ring of SlayingRing210CBlue1Gordian Ring of AimingRing210CBlue1Gordian Ring of CastingRing210CBlue1Gordian Ring of HealingRing210CBlue1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
