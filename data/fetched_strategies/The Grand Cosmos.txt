As with so many wonders of the world that once was, its radiance quickly faded in the wake of the Flood, its halls falling silent, the throne sitting empty. That is, until the palace was given new purpose when a mage claimed it as their sanctuary, their only company being solace, solitude, and the legion of familiars barring entrance to any foolish enough to seek an audience.— In-game descriptionThe Grand Cosmosis a level 80dungeonintroduced inpatch 5.1withShadowbringers.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Seeker of Solitude3.2Leannan Sith3.3Insatiable Flame: Lugus4Loot4.1Seeker of Solitude4.2Leannan Sith4.3Lugus4.4Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 12.6 Y: 13.5)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 12.4 Y: 10.7)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 12.2 Y: 7.2)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 11.9 Y: 6.4)5Achievements6Images6.1Gear Images6.2Dungeon Images6.3Other ImagesDuty SupportParty member selection is available.Crystal ExarchAlphinaudAlisaieY'shtolaClassAll-RounderAcademicianRed MageSorceressRoleAnyHealerDPSDPSObjectivesArrive at the Martial Court: 0/1Clear the Martial Court: 0/1Arrive at the Font of Quintessence: 0/1Clear the Font of Quintessence: 0/1Arrive at the Chamber of Celestial Song: 0/1DefeatLugus: 0/1BossesThe Grand Cosmos GuideSeeker of SolitudeShadowbolt:Tankbuster.Immortal Anathema:Moderate party-wide damage.Tribulation:Creates five small puddles on the floor that inflictBleedingandHeavyto players standing in them.Sweep:After a short delay, theMagicked Broomson the edges of the room will move in straight lines to a puddle in their 'lane'. While moving, the brooms will damage and knock back players in their path, inflicting a stack ofVulnerability Up.

At the end of the long cast, the Leannan Seeds will sprout intoLover's Ringadds. Seeds that sprout on barren tiles immediately die, while seeds sprouting on grass tiles must be killed through combat.Toxic Sprout:If left alive for too long, the Lover's Rings will self-destruct to deal high damage to the entire party while also inflictingSlowand a stack ofPoison.Ode to Far Winds:Eight ground-targeted Circle AoEs and four player-targeted AoEs with very little room to avoid taking two hits from the attack.Ode to Fallen Petals:Cast immediately after Ode to Far Winds. A room-wide AoE that leaves a small area around the boss safe.Ireful Wind:Subsequent casts of Direct Seeding will cause a Djinn to appear on one edge of the arena that will knock all players and seeds over one tile directly away from the add just as Gardener's Hymn casts.Insatiable Flame:LugusScorching Left/Right:Hits the entire arena on the indicated side for high damage and a stack ofVulnerability Up.Otherworldly Heat:Indicated by a red marker above all players.

Damage from this attack can destroy the furniture around the room.Captive Bolt:Extremely damaging tankbuster.Mortal Flame:Applies a debuff inflicts steadily-increasing damage every few seconds, resulting in death when the timer runs out. Walking into a piece of furniture will pass the debuff onto it, curing you while destroying the object.If an object in the room has a name, it is valid to be walked intoBut, only one object per participant. So if someone else or a Trust NPC ignites a piano or stool, you can't also use it. Find something nearby instead.Players cannot transfer the debuff between each other. Keep this in mind if there isn't enough furniture for all players to remove their debuffs.Fire's Domain:Proximity-based tethers to each player in sequence, charging at them for moderate damage. Move away to turn the tether purple to avoid being inflicted with a stack ofVulnerability Up. Standing in Lugus's path as he charges causes moderate damage.Fire's Ire:After each charge, casts a short but wide cone attack at the targeted player. This attack can destroy the furniture around the room.Culling Blade:Moderate party-wide damage. The first time Lugus uses this ability, three chandeliers will drop into the room. These chandeliers can be used to remove Mortal Flame.LootSee also:Warg ArmorandWarg AccessoriesSeeker of SolitudeNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBattledance Materia VIIMateria420ABasic1Heavens' Eye
