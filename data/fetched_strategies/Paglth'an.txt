Though the herding of livestock keeps them constantly on the move, the permanent settlement of Zolm'ak forms the seat of power and center of their society. It is there the Telophoroi would wreak destruction, dispatching a vast host comprised of both imperial soldiers and tempered dragons, with Lunar Bahamut at its head. Yet even against these heretofore unimagined foes the Amalj'aa stand strong, with Estinien, the recently freed Tiamat, and the Eorzean Alliance at their side and eager to turn the tide.— In-game descriptionPaglth'anis a level 80dungeonintroduced inpatch 5.5withShadowbringers.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Amhuluk3.2Magitek Fortress3.3Telotherium: Lunar Bahamut4Loot4.1Amhuluk4.2Magitek Fortress4.3Lunar Bahamut4.4Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 12.8 Y: 12.3)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 15.5 Y: 11.4)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 18.0 Y: 9.1)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 16.6 Y: 10.5)5Achievements6Images6.1Gear Images6.2Dungeon Images6.3Other ImagesDuty SupportParty member selection is available.G'raha TiaThancredUriangerAlphinaudAlisaieY'shtolaClassAll-RounderGunbreakerAstrologianAcademicianRed MageSorceressRoleAnyTankHealerHealerDPSDPSObjectivesArrive at the gathering ring: 0/1Clear the gathering ring: 0/1Arrive at the scalekin pen: 0/1Clear the scalekin pen: 0/1Arrive at Sunseat: 0/1DefeatLunar Bahamut: 0/1BossesVideo guide by MTQcaptureAmhulukCritical Rip: Tankbuster.Lightning Bolt: Large targeted circle AoEs on all players with additional ones on random lampposts on the edge of the arena.

PrecedesLightning Boltfrom the second cast onward.Wide Blaster: Wide cone from Amhuluk's front. Immediately followed bySpike Flail.Spike Flail: Narrow cone from Amhuluk's rear. Used immediately afterWide Blaster, with no time to avoid.Magitek FortressThe main target is theMagitek Core, guarded by a force field. To get to the Core, the party must defeat waves of adds.While fighting the adds, two of the three cannons on the fortress will charge up a blue energy and eventually blast a line ahead of it, dealing damage and inflicting a stack ofVulnerability Up.The first wave consists of threeTempered Imperialsand twoTelotek Predators. After a few moments, six more Tempered Imperials will emerge from the sides of the fortress.Magitek Claw: Used by Telotek Predators. The Predator jumps at its primary target, dealing moderate damage.2-tonze Magitek Missile: Large circle AoE below a random player.Once the entirety of a wave has been defeated, the cannons will power down, the Amalj'aa on the outside of the arena will disable the force field, and a jump pad to the Core will appear.Defensive Reaction: High party-wide damage. Only cast when the Magitek Core is directly under attack, and is the core's only method of direct attack.After reaching 50% health, the Magitek Core will eject the party back into the arena and reactivate the force field, at which point the second wave of adds appears and new mechanics are added to the cannons.The second wave begins with sixTempered Imperials, twoTelotek Sky Armors, and a singleMark II Telotek Colossus. Eventually, six Tempered Imperials and two Telotek Predators will appear.Aethershot: Used by Telotek Sky Armors. Circle AoE below a random player.Exhaust: Used by the Mark II Telotek Colossus.

After the initial explosion, a second circle AoE will appear where each player was standing when the first strike went off, exploding a few moments later.Megaflare Dive: Lunar Bahamut becomes untargetable, moves to one edge of the arena, then dive bombs in a line across, dealing high damage and knockback to players hit. Lunar Bahamut precedes this attack with aTwisted Screamthat leaves nails in the safe areas for the attack.Kan Rhai: Targets a random player with a short cross AoE. After a few seconds, energy erupts from the ground below where the player was standing, leaving a lingering AoE that pulses high damage every second for a few seconds. If the fight is allowed to drag on, subsequent casts of Kan Rhai will target multiple players.Lunar Flare: Covers the arena in purple circle AoEs that shrink over time, gradually exposing safe area(s). The attack can leave four safe areas along the edge of the arena, or a single safe area in the direct center, but not both at the same time.Gigaflare: High unavoidable party-wide damage.Flatten: Tankbuster. This is used late in the fight so it is often skipped with enough dps.LootSee also:Paglth'an ArmorandPaglth'an AccessoriesAmhuluk20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem
