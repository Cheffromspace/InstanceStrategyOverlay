It is in the Deepcroft that these twisted souls silently plot revenge against those who fought to prevent the advent of Dalamud, summoning any dark presence who will aid them to this end... no matter what the cost.— In-game descriptionThe Tam-Tara Deepcroftis a level 16dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Void Soulcounter3.2Galvanth the Dominator4Bestiary5Loot5.1Void Soulcounter5.2Void Soulcounter5.3Void Soulcounter5.4Galvanth the Dominator5.5Treasure Coffers5.5.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 9.2 Y: 7.8)5.5.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 7.9 Y: 9.3)5.5.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 4.7 Y: 9.9)6Achievements7Images8Lore8.1Revenge Of The Lambs8.2Galvanth the Dominator8.3A Letter To Spell The End8.4Avere BravearmDuty SupportEager MarauderEager ConjurerEager ThaumaturgeEager LancerClassMarauderConjurerThaumaturgeLancerRoleTankHealerDPSDPSObjectivesCultist orbs destroyed: 0/4Cultist Rosaries: 0/1Sealed broken barriers: 0/1DefeatGalvanth the Dominator: 0/1BossesTam-Tara Deepcroft GuideVoid SoulcounterVoid Soulcounter (Demon) appears after the destruction of each sealed barrier.Galvanth the DominatorGalvanth the Dominator (Soulflayer) is the main boss of Tam-Tara Deepcroft.

Rising to infamy as the sun set on the Sixth Astral Era, these twisted souls kidnapped hapless citizens to offer as blood sacrifices to hasten their god's coming. With Dalamud’s fiery destruction, however, their prophecy went unfilled, and it appeared as though the flock would scatter to the winds. Alas, the flames of fanaticism are not easily extinguished, and the embittered cultists swore vengeance against those who denied them their salvation, plotting to use the remains of the dead to call forth a dread voidsent. Hard-pressed to deal with the threat, the Gods' Quiver petitioned the aid of adventurers, a band of whom braved the crypts dark depths to put an end to the cultists and their baleful ambitions.Galvanth the DominatorIn life, King Galvanth of Gelmorra was a mighty ruler and a peerless lancer and in death, this rendered him an ideal vessel for a formidable voidsent. That which was ultimately summoned was soul eater, a being, occupying the sixth rank of the hierarchy of twelve. After the voidsent was vanquished, the Padjal E-Sumi-Uni performed art of purification upon Galvanth’s corpse, laying him to eternal rest once more.A Letter To Spell The EndIt all began with a letter to Paiyo Reiyo. The sender was a former adventuring companion, the conjurer Edda, and the content was an invitation to her wedding—to her deceased fiancé, Avere. Though the bereaved maiden had put on a brave face in the beginning, it would seem the weight of her loss was too much to bear. Suppressing a welling sense of dread, Paiyo Reiyo decided to confront his past and set forth for the ceremony’s ominous venue: the Tam-Tara Deepcroft.Prior to this, the Lalafell had taken into his confidence an accomplished adventurer, and he was wise to do so, for it spared him a fate worse than death. Having freed him from his entrapment, the adventurer descended into the bowels of the crypt, where he came face-to-face with Edda herself. The grief-mad maiden commenced a dark ritual using Avere’s macabre remains, but her plan was thwarted and she slipped and fell, plummeting into the abyss.Avere BravearmA ghastly being quickened by means of necromancy, using the head of the deceased adventurer. How Edda came into possession of it, or indeed why, may never be known. It's clear, however, that their path shall ever lead to tragedy.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
