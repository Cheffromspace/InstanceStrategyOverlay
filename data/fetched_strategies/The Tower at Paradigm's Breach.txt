Sometimes it doesn't animate right away so keep an eye on the cast bar.Colossal ImpactA linear AOE attack with two variants. When the boss first casts this, he will always do it twice. First one, then the other.Hands are open to the side and mouth is glowing red'The boss will cast a line AOE down the middle of the arenaHands in fists, leaning back, yellow glowThe boss will cast line AOEs down both sides of the arenaMagic Artillery Beta- A splashing tank buster targeting each alliance's tank.Replicate- another boss will appear on the left or right side of the arena. The first time it will always be one clone, but afterwards there may be two. They are not targetableStacking the Deck- the boss will briefly tether its clones and mark the order in which they will attack. Shown by the number of blue/white cubes in front of each boss. The actual boss will always go first.The boss and its clones will castColossal Impactin the order shown duringStacking the Deck. They may cast the same version ofColossal Impactor different versions.Spheroids- Orbs appear and will spit out red balls which float towards players causing splash damage and vulnerability stacks on contact. This is often cast in conjunction withColossal Impactand an alternate version is cast withMagic Artillery AlphaMagic Artillery Alpha- AoE markers on several playersSpheroidswill be cast with this after the first cast, but instead of shooting orbs it will do two casts of line AOEs across the arena. Avoid the first cast, then move into where it was to avoid the second cast.Light Leap- two proximity AoEs appear on the left and right and boss. The boss will jump and hit these spots. Generally, run forward so you're right on him to optimize uptime.Boxes will appear at the square AOEs duringLight LeapLunge- A knockback attack that always followsLight Leap(although the boss will often castReplicateandStacking the Deckinbetween). Line yourself up with the white boxes so you are knocked back into them.The boss will eventually (starting the third cast ofLight Leap?) begin castingColossal ImpactafterLungewhenReplicateis up. Make sure to line up with a box in such a way that you are not 1, knocked off the map by the clone'slungebut also not getting caught in the boss'Colossal ImpactThis fight introduces mechanics one at a time and then quickly begins to combine them. Keep an eye on the boss' cast bars and for its physical tells to avoid taking unnecessary damage.Hansel & GretelHansel and Gretel will regularly castUpgraded ShieldandUpgraded Lance. The boss withlower HPwill always use Upgraded Shield, while the other will use Upgraded Lance.Upgraded Shield: Creates a shield around the caster's rear and flanks, leaving its front exposed. Attempting to attack a shielded side results in the attack being reflected back for high damage.Upgraded Lance: Increases the caster's damage dealt.The bosses will tether to each other if they get too close, resulting in both bosses gaining the effects of both buffs. Keep the bosses spread apart. As the bosses lack cleaving attacks, tanks can point the Shielded boss's front toward the party to allow players to deal damage to both bosses simultaneously.Wail: Raid-wide AOE.Crippling Blow: Tankbuster.Tandem Assault: Bloody Sweep: Hansel and Gretel move to one edge of the arena and hold their halberds into the air, coating them in flames. Subsequent uses of the ability may also tether the bosses together with a red-and-blue arrow helix, indicating that the bosses will swap places with each other before the following attack happens.Bloody Sweep: Deals damage on sides of the arena based on how the bosses hold their weapons: If both halberds are held on the "inside", the safe area is the furthest point from the bosses. If both halberds are held on the "outside", the safe spot is the edge of the arena between the bosses.Seed of Magic Alpha: Targeted circle AoEs on four random players. Occurs at the same time asRiot of Magic.Riot of Magic: Stack marker on a fifth random player. Occurs at the same time asSeed of Magic Alpha.Note, later in the fight:Seed of Magic AlphaandRiot of Magicare used without cast bars, but the AoEs and Stack markers are telegraphed as normal.Tandem Assault: Passing Lance: The bosses rush to one edge of the arena and lock their halberds together in preparation forPassing Lance.Passing Lance: A line of fireballs appear in front of Hansel and Gretel to the opposite edge, with a gap somewhere in the line. The bosses will charge as a wide line AoE, and will also detonate the fireballs into narrow line AoEs perpendicular to the charge that cover the entire arena, save for the gap with no fireball.Wandering Trail: Yellow spinning discs appear on the arena. The first time, they will simply move around the edge of the arena, damaging anyone caught in them. In later casts, they may move towards the center of the arena and back out.Breakthrough: Cast whileWandering Trail's discs are active. Hansel and Gretel will move to opposite edges of the arena, hold their halberds to one side of the arena and raise their shields, then charge into each other in the center. The attack is composed of two parts: A proximity AoE from the center of the arena that deals high damage even at the furthest point, and an AoE that hits the entire side of the arena the bosses' halberds were held out to for extreme damage.Seed of Magic Beta:Circle AoEs below six random players.Hungry Lance: Hansel and Gretel move to the center of the arena, face opposite directions, and each launch wide cone AoEs in the direction they're facing.After one of the bosses is defeated, the other will lose its Upgrade buff if it had one, interrupt any ability it was casting, and will begin repeatedly usingLamentationuntil it is defeated.Lamentation: High damage to the entire alliance.Red GirlPart 1Cruelty- Heavy raid-wide damage. She opens with this and will continue to cast it throughout the raid.The boss will create orange/redkill zonesaround the edge of the arena and the direct middle. This is appear and disappear throughout the fight, but there's a moment of safety for you to get out if you happen to be in it when it first appearsShockwave- AOE markers on select players, they will be either 'white' or 'black'. The amount of time you have until it explodes is indicated by the ring above each player's head. Be careful not to stack too many of these on accident as you can kill yourself or someone else by doing soGenerate: Barrier(part 1) - White and black barriers form a cross through the arena. This is cast immediately afterShockwaveand the players marked byShockwaveare to line up with the blocks opposite the color of their AOE to destroy it. Ground AOEs (white or black) will appear under some sections of barrier, in which case someone with an AOE does not have to line up with that section as it will be destroyed by the ground AOE.Black AOELine up with a 'White' barrier to destroy itWhite AOELine up with a 'Black' barrier to destroy itVariant- Instead of a cross, this one will be a box. Players inside will be stuck inside and some close by might be sucked in, too.Generate: Barrier(part 2) - This will often follow the firstGenerate: Barriercast and features a line of arrows on one side of the arena. You want to position yourself so that you have a section of barrier of the SAME color as the arrow is between you and the arrow.(arrow) > (barrier section of same color) > you, the playerNote: The barriers don't affect line of sight, so healers can continue to AOE heal and ranged DPS can continue to DPSRecreate MeteorThis first shows up after thevariantcasts ofGenerate: Barrierand will appear in the middle of what's left of the box. Players need to position themselves such that a section of barrier the same color as the coming meteor (shown by the color on the ground and pulsing effects) is between them and the meteor(meteor) > (barrier section of the same color) > you, the playerManipulate Energy- Splashing tankbusters that target all three alliance tanksReplicate- The boss will create a number of regular sized red girls around the arena and each girl will then telegraph 1, their triangular aoe and 2, the direction in which they will rotate.The suggested way to deal with this is pick a girl and stick right behind her and rotate with herSublime Transcendence-Crueltybut also the phase change. Healers have a very short window in which to heal their party back up before they are pulled into the intermission phase and will be unable to heal until Phase 3.Intermission phaseThe hacking minigame from NiER: Automata. You'll be a little pointy triangle with two abilities: Shoot and Change Color. It's very short.You must be the opposite color of the 'barriers' andPylonsto damage themYou must be the same color as the pulsing ground AOE to avoid the pulsing ground AOE. You can also look at the cast bar to know what color to match (Wave: BlackorWave: White)You must destroy thePylonsbefore you can continue to damageRed SpherePart 2Note:This phase will open with Cruelty, so healers make sure your alliance has sufficient health if you were unable to do so before going into intermission phase.Child's Play- A number of players will be tethered by chains and will be subjected toForced Marchin the direction indicated by the arrows aroundRed Girl'shandLater in the fight, when there are multiple largeRed Girl's,Child's Playwill be cast by each largeRed GirlalongsideReplicateand tether instead to the myriad of regular sized Red Girls around the arena and be pulled in various directions.Pick a girl, rotate with her until she's pulled away, and if no red girls get pulled to you you're safe, if one does get pulled to you quickly adjust to rotate with her.The direction options are: Left, Right, and In (towards her). She will never push you away.AOEs will spawn on the ground during this but will go off AFTERForced Marchexpired.What you want to do is ensure you are in a safe spot when you are released fromForced March, which often means you will start by standing in an AOE so you will end not standing in an AOE. Be mindful of the killzones along the edge and in the middle of the arenaShockwave- In this phase, this will be cast withChild's Playinstead ofGenerate: BarrierIt will target both on tethered and untethered players. The color is irrelevant, just try not to stack too many AOEs or you'll die. It's a regular player-targeted aoe.Generate: Barrier- Unlike in phase 1, this will NOT be followed byShockwaveand there will be gaps already in the barrier. Arrows will also now appear in both colors and in both directions, but the same principles apply as before. Be between a barrier of the same color as its oncoming arrow.This is now ALWAYS cast TWICE and the arrows will be perpendicular on their second cast. So if they initially cast east/west + west/east they will then be cast north/south + south/north)Recreate Meteor- This is cast after twoGenerate: Barrierand unlike in phase 1 there aretwometeors, one black and one white.Generate: BarrierRepeats ONCE on top of this and will remove sections of barrier.You want 1, avoidGenerate: Barrierand 2, run to the safe zone where a black barrier and white barrier are between you and their respectively colored meteors. There will be only one safe combination of barrier sections.This is probably the single most complicated fight in the raid and harshest to newcomers. Everyone dies here. A lot. Especially with how many instant kill attacks there are. Take your time to learn the mechanics and be patient with both yourself and others.It is highly recommended to not LB until you are sure you will not need healer LB3.Xun-Zi & Meng-ZiMini bosses. You will first start with Xun-Zi and when sufficiently damaged they will temporarily exit and then return on the north side of the platform with Meng-Zi spawning on the west.The only mechanics worth noting are as follows:Deploy ArmamentsTelegraphed attacks used by both mid-bosses following the same rules asKnave of Heartsin the first battle,Red- A line AOE down the middleYellow- Line AOEs down the sidesThis attack will be performed by bothXun-ZiandMeng-Zione after another so make sure to position accordingly41626572726174696F6E:False IdolPart 1Screaming Score- raid-wide damageMade Magic- A red wheel will appear and start turning towards one side of the arena ,look at which way and head to the opposite way (so if the wheel is spinning to the right, go left and vice versa)Lighter Note- AoEs will spawn on 3 players and once placed/set will consecutively fire in the direction of the arrowsRhythm Rings- Rings will appear in front of the boss and purple bullets will slowly fall, get out of the way of them as beams will fire the entire part of the arenaThere will be two rounds of this, and boss will also castSeeds of Magicwhich are small AoE puddles from the sky that fallPart 2Made Magic- A red wheel will appear and start turning towards one side of the arena, look at which way and head to the opposite way (so if the wheel is spinning to the right, go left and vice versa).Screaming Score- raid-wide damageDarker Note- all three tanks get a pink AoE damage markerLighter Note- AoEs will spawn on 3 players and once placed/set will consecutively fire in the direction of the arrowsMade Magic- A red wheel will appear and start turning towards one side of the arena; look at which way and head to the opposite way (so if the wheel is spinning to the right, go left and vice versa).Eminence- raid-wide damage and aDown for the Countbuff applied, followed by cutscene and transition into next phase/boss. The party will also receive a checkpoint and will not need to repeat this boss if they wipe to the next one.Her InflorescencePart 1Pervasion- the floor will become transparent, getting you ready for next castRecreate Structure- a building below the floor will have a 5 circle countdown and you can see where/when it is going to come up - dodge as necessary.
