NoticeAll Lv. 50 Bahamut raids do not appear in anyDuty Roulettesdue to their high difficulty (comparable to Savage). Therefore, attempting to queue throughDuty Finderwill result in extremely long queues. For an easy completion, it is recommended that players useParty Finderand form anUnrestricted Party(i.e., with level sync disabled). Players who wish to complete this duty with level sync enabled should also form a pre-made party, which also enables the use ofMinimum Item LevelandSilence Echosettings for an additional challenge.This article is about the level 50 challenge-moderaid.

It is the hardest instance onpatch 2.2ofA Realm Reborn. The dungeon was first completed by theFree CompanyOrder of the Blue Garteron Excaliburserveron April 13, 2014.ObjectivesDefeatNael Deus Darnus.StrategyNael Deus DarnusMTQCapture Video GuidePhase 1: 100%-65%Ravensclaw: Hard-hitting tankbuster on the main enmity target. Use cooldowns to mitigate.Ravensbeak: Tankbuster on the highest level enmity target. Players hit by this are debuffed withRaven Blight, which explodes on its resolution, dealing damage to the inflicted player and splash damage to anyone nearby.Stardust: A random player is targeted with a marker over their head. Shortly after, a comet will drop where the player is standing, and deals proximity damage. Players must be careful not to drop these meteors too close to each other, or they will explode and wipe the raid.Iron Chariot: The boss will performRaven Diveon a random ranged DPS player, then use an AoE knockback, sending players nearby into the wall, causing death. Players can use a knockback skill to resist this.Thermonic Beam: A player is marked and is dealt massive damage. Players must stack with this marked player to split the damage, or the marked player will not survive.Lunar Dynamo: A donut AoE. Players must stand under the boss or out of range of this attack, as the boss recovers HP for damage dealt from this attack.Meteor Stream: Four random players are marked. Shortly afterwards, clones of the boss will drop on them and deal medium damage.Raven Dive: Performed before and afterIron Chariot. The boss will jump to a random ranged player, performIron Chariot, then jump back to the main tank.Dalamud Dive: AfterMeteor Stream, the boss will return and deal high damage to a tank.These mechanics will repeat until the boss is reduced to 65% HP.Phase 2During this phase, the boss will not be targetable. The boss will summon ads that must be dealt with appropriately. The boss will jump to the center of the arena and put up a shield, then three random players will be marked with green stone markers, with meteors dropped on them soon after. Players must drop these meteors around the arena in order to handle mechanics later. A common strategy is to drop one on each of the circles around the center of the arena. The boss will drop three meteors that will turn intoDalamud Spawn:Red Dalamud Spawn:Earthen Heart: Deals high damage on all players hit by the AoE and drops a blue puddle on the ground. Players who stand in this puddle will receive aBurnsdamage over time debuff that deals 1000 damage per tick.Heavy Strike: Deals heavy damage in an AoE that has a small safe zone.Blue Dalamud Spawn:Magnetism: Pulls in any players, ads or comets with in a small radius.Earthshock: high raid-wide damage andParalysison all players. This attack must beinterrupted.Green Dalamud Spawn:Demolish: Deals high raid-wide damage.Stone skull: A high-damage tankbuster.Boulder Clap: A cleave from the front of the ad's hitbox, deals high damage.Players need to 'feed' the boulders to the ads by bringing them near the comets, but a golem can only be fed three comets, or it will grow in size and wipe the raid. The red comets give aDamage Upbuff, and the yellow comets giveHaste. These buffs can stack. If these ads are brought too close to one another, they will tether, one will eat the other and grow large, wiping the raid.
About a minute after the ads spawn, the phase repeats and needs to be handled the same way. Another minute after this, the boss will begin counting down before it castsMegaflare. This attack will deal high damage to the party. If any comets remain on the field, they will explode and wipe the raid. If two or more golems still remain, they will fuse and wipe the raid. The arena will transform and the boss will jump into the air.Phase 3: 65%-47%Dalamud Dive: This is the same attack from the first phase.Heavensfall: A large pillar will slam into the center of the arena and knock players back. If a player is under the tower when it drops, they die. The pillar will pulse out AoEs that go to the edge of the arena. If a player is hit by this, it will deal significant damage and debuff withParalysis.Supernova: Two random players will be targeted and hit by a black hole, which persist after casting. Players who step into these are dealt high damage and inflicted with theHeavydebuff.Bahamut's Claw: Hits the main target twice in a row for medium damage.Binding Coil: Deals a small amount of damage and debuffs withGarrote Twist, which applies stacks ofGarrote. This debuff will immediately kill the player at 9 stacks.After the firstHeavensfall, aGhost of Meracydiawill spawn. The off tank needs to grab this ad, and it should be burned down quickly.Deadly Drive: Heavy-hitting tankbuster.Binding Chain: The ad will tether two random players together and begin applying stacks ofGarrote. If the attack finishes casting, the tethered players will die.The ad can also drop fire puddles, so players need to be sure to not stand in them.Phase 4: 47%-0%Once the boss reaches 47%, it will summon ads outside of the arena, and combine attacks from the first phase. Some attacks mechanics have also changed:Bahamut's Favor: Buffs the boss with a stackingDamage Upbuff.Bahamut's Claw: This attack now hits 5 times in a row.Supernova: This attack now targets any player, including the main tank.Lunar Dynamonow pairs withRaven Diveinstead ofIron Chariot.Dalamud DiveUnchanged from the first phase but is paired now withMeteor Stream.The boss only usesIron Charioton the main tank instead of a random player.The ads on the edge of the arena will occasionally fire attacks at randomly selected players, adding additional mechanics to the phase:Chain Lightning: A random player is targeted and deals a small amount of damage and debuffs withThunderstruck. When this debuff resolves, it deals heavy damage to the player inflicted, as well as players close by in an AoE, and debuffs withParalysison anyone other than the originally debuffed player. This attack always firesFireball.Fireball: A random player is targeted and an AoE drops on them, and debuffs the player withScorched, which makes the nextFireballhit extremely hard. However, each player will be cycled through before hitting the same character again. The only way to remove this debuff is to be hit byIceball.Iceball:  A random player is attacked, debuffing the player withFrostbitten, which makes the nextIceballhit extremely hard. However, each player will be cycled through before hitting the same character again. The only way to remove this debuff is to be hit byFireball.Cauterize: Two players are marked, and two dragons will drop on the first marked player, then another dragon will breathe fire on the second player in a wide frontal AoE, which everyone needs to be away from. To handle this, players need to move around the edge of the arena to drop these attacks away from the party.The boss will cycle through these attacks with the dragons firing attacks and debuffs in a set order as well until around 13 minutes and the boss enrages. When the boss enrages, players will have to kill the boss before theMegaflarecast finishes, or the party will be wiped.LootSee also:High Allagan WeaponsNael Deus Darnus20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsWhite Raven Armor FragmentTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityHigh Allagan Aetherstone - WeaponryMaterialN/AABasic1High Allagan Aetherstone - Body GearMaterialN/AABasic1High Allagan Chest Gear Coffer (IL 110)OtherN/AABasic1Faded Copy of Rise of the White RavenOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPaladin's High Allagan Arms (IL 115)OtherN/ACBlue1High Allagan BattleaxeMarauder's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan GuillotineDark Knight's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan SpearLancer's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan BaghnakhsPugilist's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan CleaversRogue's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Composite BowArcher's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan PistolMachinist's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan StaffTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Grimoire of CastingArcanist's Grimoire115CBlue1High Allagan CrookTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Grimoire of HealingScholar's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Star GlobeAstrologian's Arm115CBlue1High Allagan Weapon Coffer (IL 115)OtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchIn Another Bind I5Completethe Second Coil of Bahamut.-2.2In Another Bind II10Completethe Second Coil of Bahamut5 times.-2.2In Another Bind III20Completethe Second Coil of Bahamut10 times.-2.2Mightier than the Raven5Completethe Second Coil of Bahamut - Turn 4with a party of onlyblue mages,Silence Echoturned on, andUnrestricted Partyturned off.-5.15DialogueCutsceneAlisaie:That...that surely cannot be Dalamud!? How─ Where are we!?If played 1.0Nael Deus Darnus:Your companion knows this place well. For it was here that she/he slew Nael van Darnus.If did not play 1.0Nael Deus Darnus:The final resting place of Nael van Darnus.BothNael Deus Darnus:This is a grave for the undeserving.Nael Deus Darnus:And for the crime of trespassing upon my god's sanctuary, this place shall serve as your grave too!Alisaie:>> No! <<Nael Deus Darnus:In the hour of his failure, Nael van Darnus felt the currents of aether begin to bear away his essence. But before oblivion could claim the last of him, a divine will reached out...and I was born.Nael Deus Darnus:Then did the words of my god resound in mine ears...Nael Deus Darnus:“Bring unto mine enemies crushing defeat, that they might know despair without end! And claim thee thus the victory which thou wert once denied!”Alisaie:...'Twould seem that little remained of Nael's essence when Bahamut plucked him from the brink of oblivion. And the result was this strange...simulacrum. Nevertheless, her aura bespeaks great power. She channels the rage of the elder primal himself...Nael Deus Darnus:Lord Bahamut! Thy wish is my command! None shall 'scape Thine unquenchable fury!Nael Deus Darnus:Come, ye dull, unthinking beasts...bare your teeth!Nael Deus Darnus:They will avail you naught in the calamity to come!CutsceneAlisaie:Poor creature. Would that you had never been born.Alisaie:You had surrendered your physical form, and collapsed into aether... But Bahamut denied you death, and imprisoned what little was left of you in an aetherial shell resembling...what, I wonder? Images from your memory, perhaps?Alisaie:But that shell is now broken. And your primal deity seems disinclined to sustain your existence.Nael Deus Darnus:My “primal deity”? I kneel to no eikon! What need have I to beg the favor of such filth!?Nael Van Darnus:I am Nael van Darnus! Legatus of the VIIth Legion...Nael Van Darnus:No... A moment... My thoughts are clouded...and this body is not mine own. Could it be that you spoke the truth? Was I ensorcelled by the lesser moon's ancient prisoner? ...That will not happen again.Alisaie:You speak as if Bahamut no longer controlled you! But that's impossible! Once a primal ensnares a mind, it cannot be freed!Alisaie:Unless... Unless Bahamut simply relinquished his claim. What need has he of a broken spirit bound for the aetherial realm?Nael Van Darnus:Ohhh...that I should fall prey to the very influence I sought to purge from the land. The irony is galling.Nael Van Darnus:But do not assume that all of my actions were chosen for me. It wasmywill that the Meteor project be resurrected─mine and none other.Nael Van Darnus:Yet it seems that my grand designs were destined to fail. Even the ungentle release of death was denied me...Alisaie:Nael, please. You must tell us more of the Calamity. I must know the truth of what has befallen the world...and what has become of my grandfather, Archon Louisoix.Nael Van Darnus:You are Louisoix's grandchild? Ah, the fates are generous with their cruelty.Nael Van Darnus:Continue on, if you would have your answers─they await you at the terminus of your path. But know that this path leads only to despair. The light of truth was ever harsh and unforgiving...Alisaie:Why do you say this? Grandfather will be freed once we put a stop to Bahamut's restoration, will he not? What are you not telling us!?Nael Van Darnus:Steel yourself, child. Only unbending resolve and merciless strength can conquer what lies ahead.Nael Van Darnus:The weak can do naught but weep under the pall of their own misery. As did the frail child I once was...???:Silence, chattering raven. Your wretched wings are broken, and you shall soar no more.Nael Van Darnus:My crimson moon... Your brilliance sears mine eyes...Alisaie:I recognize that voice, [Forename]. But never would he say such words...Alisaie:Come, let us finish what we came to do. All will be put aright when the final hulk lies dormant. Grandfather will be himself again...I'm sure of it.CutsceneAlisaie:Bahamut regenerates more swiftly than I had anticipated. Let us hope that disabling this coil will serve to slow the process.Alisaie:The display seems...different, but the controls appear to mimic the mechanism we found in the La Noscean hulk. It shouldn't pose a problem.Alisaie:...[Forename], forgive me. The moment I beheld Nael's transformation, hope wilted in my heart. I did not believe you could stand against the manifestation of Bahamut's power.Alisaie:For all your fabled strength and skill, I felt certain then that I was going to lose you─just as I lost my grandfather. Even he, a man for whom naught seemed impossible, was humbled before Bahamut's might.Alisaie:And yet, look how far we have come.Alisaie:'Tis incredible the feats of which we are capable─our boundless potential.Alisaie:'Twas this capacity for greatness, I believe, that Grandfather so dearly wished to protect. With all that has occurred, I have come to understand that much at least.Alisaie:'Tis done. Shall we make our way back to the surface and gather our thoughts? We have seen much that will benefit from Urianger's learned perspective.Alisaie:Grandfather!? Itisyou! Then...why?Louisoix:Abandon this quest, Alisaie. I will not countenance further sabotage of the coils.Alisaie:“Sabotage”? But...but we must disable the coils if we are to prevent Bahamut's revival!Lousioix:Your defiance seals your fate.Alisaie:No... No, you are not who I thought you were... My grandfather wouldnever...Lousioix:Foolish girl.Lousioix:How could the White Raven allow herself to be bested by such sniveling opponents?Lousioix:Listen well. We all exist at the pleasure of one divine will.Lousioix:And the word of Lord Bahamut is absolute!Lousioix:Scurry back into your holes, vermin. You have been granted this one reprieve. But should you be so foolish as to crawl into my lord's domain again, I will crush the life from you myself.Alisaie:That light in Grandfather's eyes... He has suffered the same fate as Nael.Alisaie:My grandsire is no more. That was naught but a phantom that profanes his noble memory...Alisaie:This mockery must be expunged! I will not rest until I free Grandfather's soul from Bahamut's tyranny.Alisaie:Do you hear me, Bahamut? Your time is at an end!
