Should the mighty serpent be allowed to unleash a tidal wave, the entire city of Limsa Lominsa will be swept into the sea. Faced with watery oblivion, the leaders of the Maelstrom have conceived a desperate plan: by lashing together two warships and filling their holds with corrupted crystals, they hope to pierce the Lord of the Whorl's defenses and give a chosen few the chance to dispatch the primal with courage and steel. TheWhorleatersits in the bay with her towing vessel, the Triumph, awaiting but the command to cast off— In-game descriptionTheWhorleater(Hard)is a level 50trialintroduced inpatch 2.2. The trial name isitalicizedbecause it is the name of the ship upon which the fight takes place.Contents1Strategy1.1Lord of the Whorl: Leviathan1.2Phase 11.3Phase 21.4Phase 32Loot3ImagesStrategyLord of the Whorl:LeviathanPhase 1The boss will begin at the head of the ship. Here, players can simply attack the boss until either enough time passes or players push the boss to 90%. Once the boss reaches either of these thresholds, it will become untargetable and dive under the water. Players will need to be on the lookout for a large spume of water on either side of the ship. This indicates what side the boss's head will come up on, and at what end. For this first phase, the boss will always appear on the west side of the north of the arena. The boss will appear and useBody Slam, rearing up, then slamming down into the deck of the ship, stunning all players and causing them to slide to that end of the ship. Players caught under the boss will take some damage. From here the boss will become targetable, and its tail will appear opposite it at the other end of the ship.Phase 2Leviathan's HeadandLeviathan's Tailare both targetable and mirror each others HP, so dealing 100 damage to the head will also deal 100 damage to the tail. The head is covered by a barrier calledVeil of the Whorlthat reflects Physical Ranged damage, while The tail is covered by a barrier also calledVeil of the Whorlthat reflects Magic damage, so casters will want to focus on the head, and ranged players will be on the tail. Melee players can target either. The tail will only castScale Dartson the player who is it's main enmity target. The head however, will have a host of new attacks that it can cycle through:Dread Tide: A Water elemental tankbuster fired at the main enmity target.Aqua Breath: A point-blank AoE attack that deals medium damage. This is cast periodically.Water Spout: Cast on random players, deals medium damage.Tidal Roar: Unavoidable party-wide damage.During this phase, the boss will summonWavespine Sahaginsin sets of two. They will merely deal physical attacks to begin, but if not dealt with quickly, will start spam castingHydroshot, which drops a large AoE puddle under a marked player. This puddle will debuff anyone who touches it withDropsy, making them more vulnerable to Water elemental attacks. Players should focus on burning these ads down as they will continue to spawn in pairs throughout the fight.
Eventually the boss will also summonGyre Spumesin sets of four. These enemies don't attack, but will drain 8 points from the Elemental Converter each every 4 seconds. These are a priority, as without the Elemental Converter, the boss will wipe the party withTidal Wave.
The boss will sometimes become untargetable again and dive under the water, signaling what side of the ship it's moving to with another water spout. Simply be ready to move to the opposite end of the ship to avoid taking damage.
At about 60%, the boss will become untargetable and leap over the ship and useGrand Fall. This drops an AoE on a player that will sit where they were standing. Any player caught in this will be debuffed withHeavy, greatly reducing players mobility. The boss will then begin jumping from end to end of the ship. This time, when players see the spout of water, they will need to move to the opposite side of the ship, as the boss will useSpinning Dive, dealing heavy damage and knockback. 
When the boss begins usingSpinning Dive, they will need to run to the end of the ship with the Elemental Converter, as the boss is preparing to useTidal Wave, which will wipe the party if the converter is not activated in time. After this, the boss willBody Slamon an end of the ship, and the fight will continue.Phase 3The fight will continue as before, however the boss will now jump over the ship and dropGrand Falloccasionally, and begin moving from one end to the other and appear on random sides. The boss will also begin summoningWavetooth Sahagins. Like the previous ads, they will perform basic attacks, castingRuin. If not dealt with quickly, it will begin castingDreadstorm, dropping a large AoE under a player which debuffs withHysteria, causing the player to lose complete control and run around in random directions. If the player passes through the circle again, they will be rebuffed withHysteria. If two Wavetooth's are casting this, things can get chaotic very quickly, so take them down immediately.Wavespine Sahaginswill also spawn throughout the phase.
These mechanics will repeat until the boss is defeated.Loot15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsLeviathan Card(Drops at a fixed rate)Leviathan's BarbDrops directly from boss, must besyncedImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
