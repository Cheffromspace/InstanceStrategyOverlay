Sadly, it was not meant to last. Though naught but ruins remain, they remain heavily guarded nonetheless. The Qitana Ravel is perhaps the most sacred of these sites, home to the ancient wisdom of the past. With the advent of the Flood, however, you have reason to believe something more sinister now resides there as well.— In-game descriptionThe Qitana Ravelis a level 75dungeonintroduced inpatch 5.0withShadowbringers.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Notes4Bosses4.1Lozatl4.2Batsquatch4.3Lightwarden: Eros5Loot5.1Lozatl5.2Batsquatch5.3Lightwarden: Eros5.4Treasure Coffers5.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 13.9 Y: 9.5)5.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 12.1 Y: 7.3)5.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 12.0 Y: 13.2)5.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 11.0 Y: 10.8)6Achievements7Images7.1Gear Images7.2Dungeon Images7.3Other ImagesDuty SupportParty member selection is available.ThancredUriangerY'shtolaMinfiliaClassGunbreakerAstrologianSorceressOracle of LightRoleTankHealerDPSDPSObjectivesArrive in the Divine Threshold.Clear the Divine Threshold.Arrive in Shallowed Hollow.Clear Shallowed Hollow.Arrive at the Song of Ox'Gatorl.DefeatEros.NotesDuring the last trash pull, if the enemies are pulled back away from the platform (requiring some backtracking) the last set of enemies (three gorillas) will automatically join the fray.
