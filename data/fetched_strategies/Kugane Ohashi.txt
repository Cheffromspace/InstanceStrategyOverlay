In his hand, a sacred treasure, a sword without peer. Yet the enigmatic Yojimbo is a man with many secrets secreted within his many sleeves—all of which he is prepared to bring to bear against his most fearsome and radiant foe...— In-game descriptionKugane Ohashiis a level 70trialintroduced inpatch 4.56withStormblood.  It is part of theEven Further Hildibrand Adventures Questsquestline.GuideYojimboKugane Ohashi Trial GuideThroughout the fight, the boss will comment on the various attacks he uses, either by saying a phrase that appears in a speech balloon above his head. The first time the bosses uses an ability, the line will instead be shouted, appearing in a dialogue box and printed in the chat log.Phase 1Inoshikacho: Summons 4 butterflies that land on random players. When they touch the ground, they create large AoEs around them. Deals heavy damage, and may be enough to kill squishy players.Metta-giri: Moderate party-wide AoE damage.Stack in advance forInoshikachoto make it easier to dodge the butterflies.Phase 2After reaching 80% HP, Yojimbo will move to the center of the arena, become untargetable, and shout "Now we fight like men. And ladies. And men who dress like ladies! For Yojimbo... It is Gilgameshing time!". Yojimbo will sink into a black vortex, then emerge from a golden light asGilgameshand toss his hat away. Phase 2 will then begin until Gilgamesh reaches 50% HP.Icewind: Multiple crisscrossing white line AoEs will form, with squares of safe spots beneath them. Immediately after, additional crisscrossing line AoEs will cover up the previous safe spots, with new safe spots where they previously covered. Always combined withGekko.Gekko: Marks each player with a whiteish medium AoE. After a few seconds, it will go off, dealing moderate damage to all players in the AoE. Immediately drops a large pink donut AoE with the safe spot in a small circle in the center where the player is standing. While stacking would be ideal, the damage from the initial AoE will kill everyone if they stack together, so it's best to spread out enough that your pink donut doesn't overlap with other players safe spots and allows you to stay put. Gilgamesh says: "Divide and conquer, Gilgamesh style!"Bitter End: Frontal cleave on the tank. Keep facing away from the group.Tiny Song: Marks each player with a red arrow pointing down at their heads. All players must stack together to avoid being inflicted withMinimum.Dragon's Head: Summons ghostly dragon heads along one wall of the arena, with a few gaps between them. The line of heads will slowly move across the arena. Players need to stand in the gaps to avoid taking moderate damage and gainingVulnerability Updebuffs. Followed byDragon Night. Yojimbo says: "Uh-oh! Someone woke the dragon..."Dragon Night: Used by theDragon's Heads after they reach the far wall. Moderate arena-wide AoE damage.If you seeDragon's Head, top players off before they reach the end of the arena as they will useDragon Nightshortly after.Avoid standing in the front so you aren't hit withBitter End.Stack with at least 1 other player to avoid being inflicted withMinimumbyTiny Song.Keep a decent spread distance forGekkoso you aren't both hit by other's white AoEs and forced to move from their pink donut AoE.Phase 3Starts around ~40%. UsesGekkoduring this.Embodiment: After the boss leaps away, both tanks will be marked with a Flare marker. Move to opposite corners for best effect. After a few seconds, an Embodiment add will leap to each tank, dealing proximity damage to all players in the arena. These must be killed before theDivine Epicnessbar reaches 100%. They cannot be stacked or they will become almost invulnerable.Divine Epicness: When bothEmbodimentadds are dead or the bar reaches 100%, the boss will useAme-no-Murakumo.Ame-no-Murakumo: The boss does his best Susano impression and cleaves the center of the arena with a massive sword, dealing more damage the closer players are to the center while also dealing damage based on the charge of theEpicnessbar.Giga Jump: AfterAme-no-Murakumo, the boss will target the MT with a Flare marker and useGiga Jumpto jump to them, dealing proximity damage. Signals the start ofphase 4.Don't stand near the tanks forEmbodimentandGiga Jump.Avoid standing in the center of the arena so you aren't cleaved withAme-no-Murakumo.Phase 4Uses all abilities fromPhase 2in addition to the ones below.Electrogenetic Force: Has 2 variations. Deals heavy damage if hit; being struck by two or with missing health will likely kill you. Gilgamesh says: "And now for something trulyshocking!"Multiple purple lightning orbs will spawn and create large, overlapping AoEs around them, with one spot left without an orb. Players must determine safe spot and move there ASAP.Drops purple lightning orbs on random players, forcing players to move aside. Can happen duringDragon's Head.Enchain: Tethers the 2 tanks and 2 healers to the boss. After a few seconds, they will be locked inIron Chainsand begin castingHells' Gate. As he castsEnchain, Gilgamesh will say: "What's the matter, friend? All tied up?"Iron Chains: A targetable enemy entangling the tanks and healers fromEnchain. The DPS must kill the chains to free their teammates beforeHells' Gatefinishes casting, or they will die. The closer a chained player is to the boss, the stronger it will be.Hells' Gate: Used afterEnchain. Kills all players still inIron Chains.Masamune: Long line AoE. The boss will charge down the line after a few seconds and begin castingZanma Zanmai. Gilgamesh says: "Not thestrongestof swords, but it should suffice."Zanma Zanmai: Used afterMasamune. Drops all players to 1 HP. Followed byEpic Stormsplitter. Gilgamesh says: "Behold, the sword art of legend—Zanmato!"Epic Stormsplitter: A thin blue line AoE down the center of the arena. About halfway through the cast, two additional AoEs will spawn, covering the majority of the arena except for a thin strip down the middle of the blue line AoE. Wait for the blue AoE to go off, then move into the safe spot to avoid the secondary AoE. Gilgamesh says: "The seas part for Gilgamesh alone!"The boss will start using more abilities together, likeDragon's HeadandTiny Song. Just continue to do the mechanics properly as they come and you'll do just fine.Wait for the blue AoE to go off inEpic Stormsplitterbefore you move into the safe spot or you'll take heavy damage.The chained players should move some distance away from the boss and stack to make destroying the chains easier.Loot10Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsStormblood Gilgamesh Card(drops at a fixed rate)Treasure CofferNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityYojimbo BardingOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchBite Me10DefeatYojimboonKugane Ohashi.-4.56DialogueYojimbo: The time has come and so have I!
