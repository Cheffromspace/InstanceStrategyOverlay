Alas, just when it seems the great wyrm's liberation is in sight, you are forced to watch as she is twisted into a being of Darkness by her captor Golbez. So it is that you sally forth into the black-clad villain's conjured stage, there to end his unholy crusade and free Azdaja from her torment.— In-game descriptionThe Voidcast Daisis a level 90trialintroduced inpatch 6.4withEndwalker.Contents1Guide1.1Knight in Black: Golbez1.1.1Phase 11.1.2Phase 22Loot3Dialogue4ImagesGuideTrial Guide by MTQcaptureKnight in Black:GolbezNote that players can fall off the edge of the arena to their death, although they can be resurrected after a moderate delay.Phase 1Terrastorm: Forms rock above random corner that will explode in a briefly telegraphed circular AoE.
