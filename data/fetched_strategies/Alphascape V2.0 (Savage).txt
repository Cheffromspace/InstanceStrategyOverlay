Below is a list of all abilities used during the encounter and in the order that they occur.Ambient AetherSimilar to Normal mode, Midgardsormr will frequently draw in aether by spinning in a circular motion twice in quick succession. After he gathers aether twice, an attack will launch based on how Midgardsormr spun and in which order. The two types of spins he can do are ahorizontalspin and averticalspin. After executing two spins (which are chosen in a semi-random fashion), a specific AoE attack will be launched.Horizontal + Horizontal:Point-blank AoE that extends slightly beyond Midgardsormr's hitbox. If you notice a double horizontal spin, all players should move as far away from Midgardsormr as possible.Horizontal + Vertical:Donut AoE that leaves a safe spot inside Midgardsormr's hitbox. If you notice a horizontal-into-vertical spin, all players should move into Midgardsormr's hit-box immediately.Vertical + Vertical:Two straight-line AoEs through Midgardsormr, forming a '+' shape. One line will always be in the direction Midgardsormr is facing, with the second line always being perpendicular to the first. Seeing as Midgardsormr is typically tanked while he is facing north, all players should move to the far corner of the arena if they notice a double-vertical spin.InSavagemode, none of the attacks performed after a spin-combo will come with a telegraph. Also, Midgardsormr may stall after an initial spin to execute moves or multiple auto-attacks before performing a second spin (unlike normal mode, where Midgardsormr always performs both spins with no downtime). Lastly, there is an additional combo for players to learn:Vertical + Horizontal.Vertical + Horizontal:Two straight-line AoEs through Midgardsormr, forming an 'x' shape. Seeing as Midgardsormr is typically tanked in the middle of the arena while he is facing north, all players should move to the far north, south, east or west of the arena whenever they notice a vertical + horizontal spin, as only very small safe-zones will be present in these locations.Getting hit by any of these attacks will inflict high damage and stackableDamage DownandVulnerability Updebuffs, thus all participants must keep an eye on Midgardsormr when he begins to spin and be ready to pre-emptively react to upcoming attacks once the spin-order has been discerned.Opening PhaseTail End- a vicious and frequently used tank-buster against the primary target that requires mitigation cooldowns or even immunity cooldowns. To be extra-safe, tank-swapping is advised until later in the battle.Ambient Aether (V + H)- Midgardsormr will introduce the raid to the new combo mechanic by spinning vertically, then horizontally, indicating an upcoming 'x' shaped attack. Assuming Midgardsormr is being tanked in the center of the arena and facing north, all players should ensure that are standing within the far north, south, east or western edge of the arena.Ambient Aether (H + Akh Morn + H)- causes Midgardsormr to perform a horizontal spin, followed byAkh Morn, a stack-marker mechanic that will unleash multiple blasts of shareable damage at the marked target. After the last hit ofAkh Morn, Midgardsormr will perform a second horizontal spin, unleashing a massive point-blank AoE at his location. To avoid, simply stack up and share all hits ofAkh Morn, then be ready to move as far away from Midgardsormr as possible whilst performing the second horizontal spin.Tail End- smashes the main target with another vicious tank buster. As mentioned earlier, it is wise to tank-swap so that each tank can keep some mitigation cooldowns for future mechanics.Ambient Aether (H + Earthshaker + ?)- causes Midgardsormr to horizontally spin. After doing so,Earth Shakerwill apply a mark to all raid participants. Once the second spin has been performed (which is always random),Earth Shakerwill fire shock-waves in a line from Midgardsormr's center towards all marked players (at the same time as theAmbient Aetherattack). A good rule of thumb is to have all participants surround Midgardsormyr in a circular pattern so that no two players will be overlapped by upcoming shock-waves, and also gives everyone plenty of space to react to the upcomingAmbient Aethercombo. If Midgardsormr flips horizontally, players will need to retreat from the boss to avoid a point-blank AoE. If Midgardsormr flips vertically, all players will need to remain within Midgardsormr's hitbox to avoid the donut AoE. No matter which combo is performed,Earth Shakerwill conclude at the same time as that attack.Ambient Aether (V + Tail End + Thunderstorm + ?)- causes Midgardsormr to vertically spin. Afterwards, anotherTail End(tank-buster) will be performed against the primary target, followed by four players being marked with thunderous AoE circles. Once four players have been marked, Midgardsormr will perform a random spin. If Midgardsormr flips vertically, players must be ready to avoid the '+' shaped AoE attack. If Midgardsormr flips horizontally, players will need to avoid the 'x' shaped attack. Regardless of which attack is chosen,Thunderstormwill detonate at the same time as the ambient aether attack, so players will need to spread out in a manner where the AoE circles do not result in too much overlap.Time Immemorial- a long-cast ability that will apply a special debuff to each tank.Death from Below (Yellow)- causes attacks from grounded enemies (including Midgardsormr) to applyDoom. As a result, tanks marked with the yellow debuff must focus only on tanking flying enemies.Death from Above (Blue)- causes attacks from flying enemies (including Midgardsormr) to applyDoom. As a result, tanks marked with the blue debuff must focus only on tanking grounded enemies.Tail End- smashes the main target with another vicious tank buster. Due to the presence ofDeath from Below/Abovedebuffs, tank-swapping may not be a luxury at this point, making immunity cooldowns very desirable from here on.Ambient Aether (H + Northern Cross + ?)- causes Midgardsormr to horizontally spin. After doing so,Northern Crosswill coat the entire arena in thin ice, causing any player movement to propel that player in their chosen direction a set distance. After the arena has been converted into an icy death-trap, Midgardsormr will now spin horizontally or vertically. If horizontal, players will need to slide away from the boss to avoid the point-blank AoE. If vertical, players will need to remain within Midgardsormr's hitbox to avoid the donut AoE. A good rule of thumb is to have all players pre-emptively form a circle around Midgardsormr's hitbox beforeNorthern Crossso that everyone can remain in place to avoid the donut AoE, or slide away with ease.Ice-Storm- marks two players with very noticeable ice-circle markers. After a brief delay, players with the ice-markers will drop puddles of ice at their current location that will slowly grow in size and inflictFrostbiteupon anyone who remains within them. Bear in mind thatNorthern Cross(thin ice) will still be present at this point, forcing marked players to slide away without full control of their characters. As a rule of thumb, marked players should make an effort to drop these puddles into the outer edges of the arena - preferably the farthest corners. Once the puddles have been dropped, the arena will revert to its normal state.Akh Rhal- causes energy to erupt from beneath two random damage-dealers (in the form of multi-hitting AoE circles), dealing moderate damage several times in a row before dissipating. The targeted players will need to move out of the attack after the first unavoidable hit if they wish to avoid further damage.Ambient Aether (H + Horrid Roar + ?)- causes Midgardsormr to horizontally spin. After doing so,Horrid Roarwill spawn large AoE circles underneath all members of the raid which will detonate at the same time as the upcomingAmbient Aethercombo attack. Once the circles have been spawned, Midgardsormr will perform a second (random) spin to determine the upcoming attack. If Midgardsormr spins horizontally, players will need to dodge the AoE circles whilst moving away from the boss to avoid a point-blank AoE at its location. If Midgardsormr spins vertically, players will need to dodge the AoE circles whilst remaining within Midgardsormr's hitbox.A simple method of handling this combo is to have the entire raid bait theHorrid Roarcircle AoEs by stacking together in certain locations. For example; having both tanks stack together inside the northern section of Midgardsormr's hitbox while the rest of the raid stack on the southern side of it. Once the circles have been dropped in one location, all players can then move away (or into) Midgardsormr to avoid the upcomingAmbient Aetherattack without any risk of running into a misplaced AoE circle.Add PhaseAfter performing the previousAmbient Aethercombo (and a couple of auto-attacks), Midgardsormr will leap away from the arena, signifying theAncient Dragon(add) phase. Both tanks need to keep in mind theirTime Immemorialdebuff seeing as theAncient Dragonis agroundedenemy - which means the tank withDeath from Below(yellow debuff) will be afflicted withDoomif they are hit by theAncient Dragon. Seeing as Midgardsormr and theAncient Dragonhave shared enmity, it is wise to have the tank withDeath from Above(blue debuff) provoke Midgardsormr just before he flies out of the arena. Alternatively, the tank withDeath from Belowcan move as far from the center of the arena as possible so that the tank withDeath from Abovecan quickly provoke theAncient Dragonas soon as it spawns (before it can attack the other tank), though this is much riskier.Whilst out of the arena,Midgardsormr's Aetherwill begin to charge up in the form of a duty-gauge. TheAncient Dragon(and numerousImmortal Keys) will need to be dealt with before the gauge reaches maximum. After being spawned, the keys will tether themselves to the dragon (or other keys), and whilst the dragon is tethered by keys, it'll beInvulnerableto all player attacks. Whilst dealing with the keys, theAncient Dragonwill execute various moves that all participants must be wary of.Frost Breath- a vicious cone attack centered on the dragon's primary target. The tank assigned to the Ancient Dragon should ensure that it is always facing away from the group so that nobody else is cleaved by its nasty AoE blast.Rime Wreath- periodic arena-wide damage.Assuming theAncient Dragonis defeated in time, it will unleash a desperationDark Wave- a large point-blank AoE at its dying location. Additionally, it will leave behind a separate circle on the ground that can be walked over by a player to acquireArcane Bulwark- a special buff that will be required to negate future (lethal) mechanics. Bear in mind thatAncient Bulwarkwill transfer from one player to another whenever anyone gets close to the buff-holder, and when transferred in this manner, the player who previously held the buff will no longer be able to reap its benefits. It is wise to assign a specific player to pick up theArcane Bulwarkand make sure that it is transferred only to those in need.With theAncient Dragondefeated, Midgardsormr will blast the arena withProtostar. If Midgardsormr's aether gauge reached maximum during the add phase, the raid will suffer an unavoidable wipe. If the add phase was handled successfully, the raid will instead take survivable damage. At this point, the next phase begins with a combination of three mechanics simultaneously.Cauterize- causes Midgardsormr to re-appear somewhere along the outer edge of the arena. After a brief delay, he will quickly dive-bomb across that half of the arena, inflicting tremendous (typically fatal) damage to anyone caught in his path. To avoid, simply look for where Midgardsormr has appeared and pre-emptively move out of his upcoming flight-path. Bear in mind that the dive-bomb will take place at the same time asHorrid RoarandThunderstorm.Horrid Roar + Thunderstorm- detonates at the same time as Midgardsormr's dive-bomb (Cauterize). Whilst Midgardsormr prepares to dive-bomb across half of the arena, all players will simultaneously drop AoE circles beneath their feet (Horrid Roar) and four players will also be marked with thunderous AoE circles. Just like in the earlier phase, baiting theHorrid Roarcircles by having the group stack together will save a lot of confusion. If the group pre-emptively stacks in the center after theAncient Dragonphase, allHorrid Roarcircles can be dropped in one single location, giving the entire raid plenty of space to avoid the upcomingCauterizedive-bomb without overlappingThunderstormAoE circles in a panic.NOTE:Players must also be mindful of theAncient Bulwark. While dodging the above wave of mechanics, try not to accidentally pass it to other players, as doing so will render its previous carrier(s) immune to its benefits.Midgardsormr will now repeat the above three mechanics a second time - moving to another edge of the arena before dive-bombing across it once more, dropping AoE circles under all players (Horrid Roar) and another four AoE circles (Thunderstorm). To avoid, it is best to have everyone re-stack in the center as soon as the first trio of mechanics have concluded so thatHorrid Roarcircles can be baited once again.Assuming the raid survives the ordeal, Midgardsormr will return to the arena.Third PhaseAfter returning to the arena, players may notice that Midgardsormr is no longerflying. Instead, he will begrounded, which means that tanks have to be extra careful when it comes toDeath from AboveandDeath from Belowdebuffs. As described before, tanks withDeath from Belowmust avoid taking hits from grounded enemies.Time Immemorial- causes Midgardsormr tore-applytheDeath from Above/Belowdebuffs. Tanks must remain vigilant as there is no guarantee that they will acquire the same debuff they had before, and must also keep in mind that Midgardsormr will begroundedfor this portion of the battle.Death from Below (Yellow)- causes attacks from grounded enemies (including Midgardsormr) to applyDoom. As a result, tanks marked with the yellow debuff must focus only on tanking flying enemies.Death from Above (Blue)- causes attacks from flying enemies (including Midgardsormr) to applyDoom. As a result, tanks marked with the blue debuff must focus only on tanking grounded enemies.Once the debuffs have been re-applied, the tank withDeath from Belowmust avoid tanking Midgardsormr in his grounded state.Crimson Breath- causes Midgardsormr to mark a random player as the target for a fatal cone-AoE that can only be survived by using theAncient Bulwark. As a rule of thumb, the player carrying theAncient Bulwarkshould position themselves away from the rest of the group, typically off to the side of Midgardsormr so that the upcoming blasts will not overlap other members of the raid. Once a player has been marked forCrimson Breath, that player should run to the lone individual carrying theAncient Bulwarkso that it passes on to the marked player, rendering them immune to the upcoming attack. Meanwhile, the person who previously had theAncient Bulwarkshould retreat away from the marked player now that they no longer hold the Bulwark's immunity. If done correctly, Midgardsormr will shootCrimson Breathat the immune target with all other members of the raid out of harm's way.Midgardsormr will now repeatCrimson Breaththree more times. From here, it is a simple case of having marked victims claim theAncient Bulwark(and the previous holder retreating) until a total of four players have been blasted. If theAncient Bulwarkwas accidentally (or excessively) transferred during previous phases or mechanics, multiple players may be immune to its effect, meaning they will have no way of avoiding fatal damage if marked forCrimson Breath.Assuming all four blasts ofCrimson Breathwere successfully mitigated using theAncient Bulwark, it will now become aCrumbling Bulwark, limiting its potency during future mechanics. From here, another mini-phase begins.Crimson Orbs- summons a set of flaming orbs in the center of the arena. After a brief delay, another set of orbs will then be summoned in a random corner of the arena. Shortly after that, one final set of orbs will be spawned in theoppositecorner, essentially forming a diagonal line through the entire arena. Eventually, all sets ofCrimson Orbswill explode in a '+' shaped fashion across the arena (in the order they were summoned).If you think of the arena as a 3x3 squared platform; when the center orbs explode, the resulting AoE will cover everything except the four corner squares. After that, the second set of orbs will explode, essentially creating an 'L' shape. Finally, the opposite corner will soon explode in a reverse L shape.However, players will need to contend with (Hot Tail- see below) andHorrid RoarbeforeCrimson Orbsbegin to detonate.Horrid Roarwill cause every member of the raid to drop AoE circles beneath their feet, just like in earlier phases of the fight. In short, players will need to recognize the upcomingCrimson Orbexplosion patter/order and pre-position themselves so that they can bait theHorrid Roarcircles and THEN move into the safe spot.Hot Tail- indicated by Midgardsormr tethering himself to a random player. After a delay, Midgardsormr will launch a fiery (and very fatal) straight-line AoE through himself in the direction of the marked player, right across the entire arena. Both the initial attack (and resulting straight-line AoE) can only be survived by dodging the blast entirely, or by acquiring theCrumbling Bulwark. Seeing as the marked player is responsible for 'aiming' the attack (and completely unable to dodge the blast), they will need to acquire theCrumbling Bulwarkas soon as possible, then position themselves so that the straight-line AoE doesn't fatally cleave the raid. To complicate matters,Hot Tailwill conclude just before the third set ofCrimson Orbsexplodes.In summary:
Once the orbs begin to spawn, the entire raid should stack somewhere in the direction of the last set of orbs that spawned. The square with the last set of orbs will be a safe square while the 1st and 2nd set of orbs explode. Due to being stacked up, the entire raid can easily bait theHorrid RoarAoE circles outside of this safe square, then proceed to move into the far corner of the arena to avoid upcomingCrimson Orbexplosions. Before they explode, however, a player will be tethered to Midgardsormr, marking them forHot Tail. This person will need to acquire theCrumbling Bulwarkto survive the initial attack (making sure not to accidentally pass it to another player in the process). From here, theCrimson Orbswill begin to explode, starting with the center orbs. By stacking in the corner with the 3rd set of orbs, the raid can avoid the explosions from the central orbs and the explosion in the opposite corner, but will need to move towards the center before the final set of orbs detonate. From here, the tethered player moves into the center (remaining at a diagonal angle) so thatHot Tailshoots at a diagonal angle (while all unmarked players move to the sides of the boss, avoiding the blast).This is just one of many ways a raid can handle the mechanics, but no matter how you decide to do it, theArcane Bulwark(orCrumbling Bulwark) will likely be destroyed at this point in the battle. Assuming the raid survives, Midgardsormr will exit the arena once more.Cauterize + Horrid Roar + Exaflare- causes Midgardsormr to leave the arena and eventually re-appear somewhere along its outer edges to perform another set of dive-bombs, similar to earlier. Simultaneously, all members of the raid will begin to periodically drop AoE circles at their location due toHorrid Roar. To complicate matters further, several arrow-marked AoEs will spawn at one edge of the arena in a staggered fashion, eventually exploding across the arena in the direction of the arrow.Each of theseExaflare's (arrow-marked explosions) can only spawn once per "column" of the arena, so getting behind the first one that spawns is a good method of avoiding the remaining flares. However, players will still be periodically dropping AoE circles underneath themselves at periodic intervals, so the entire raid should stack together to bait these circles and weave through the travelling exaflare explosions in a staggered manner. Don't forget -- Midgardsormr will still be dive-bombing as well, rendering halves of the arena unsafe.After the dive-bomb frenzy subsides, Midgardsormr will return to the arena and will now beflyingonce more. From here on, the tank withDeath from Abovemust NOT tank Midgardsormr.Tail End- Midgardsormr will immediately slap the main target with his vicious tank-buster.Akh Morn- the stack-marker mechanic from earlier, unleashing multiple blasts of damage at the marked target that must be shared by the group.Horrid Roar + Thunderstorm- marksALLplayers with thunderous AoE circles and also causes all members of the raid to drop AoE circles beneath their feet, forcing the entire raid to dodge dropped circles without overlapping their thunderous AoEs.Ambient Aether (V + Thunderstorm + ?)- causes Midgardsormr to vertically spin. Afterwards, four players will be marked with thunderous AoE circles. Once four players have been marked, Midgardsormr will perform a random spin. If Midgardsormr flips vertically, players must be ready to avoid the '+' shaped AoE attack. If Midgardsormr flips horizontally, players will need to avoid the 'x' shaped attack. Regardless of which attack is chosen,Thunderstormwill detonate at the same time as the ambient aether attack, so players will need to spread out in a manner where the AoE circles do not result in too much overlap.Time Immemorial- causes Midgardsormr tore-applytheDeath from Above/Belowdebuff. As always, tanks must be ready to react if their debuffs are swapped. Remember, Midgardsormr isflyingat this point, thus the tank withDeath from Above (Blue)must avoid tanking the boss.Exaflare + Ice-Storm + Akh Morn- marks two players with very noticeable ice-circle markers. Just like earlier, players with these ice-markers will eventually drop puddles of ice at their current location that will slowly grow in size and cover a large portion of the arena. Simultaneously,Exaflares(travelling explosions) will soon begin to detonate across the arena in staggered columns. It is wise to have unmarked players weave between the exaflares close to where they are spawning, whilst the ice-marked players move to the opposite edge of the arena to drop their ice-puddles away from the group, dodging through the exaflares on their way back. During all this, a stack-marker will be placed on a player, forcing the group to stack up and soak the multi-hitting attack (while dodging exaflares).Ambient Aether (V + Northern Cross + Thunderstorm + ?)- causes Midgardsormr to vertically spin. Afterwards,Northern Crosswill coat the entire arena in thin ice, causing any player movement to propel that player in their chosen direction a set distance. Four players will also be marked with thunderous AoE circles. It is wise to pre-position the raid in a circular pattern within Midgardsormr's hitbox. If Midgardsormr flips vertically, players must be ready to avoid the '+' shaped AoE attack. If Midgardsormr flips horizontally, players will need to avoid the 'x' shaped attack. Due to both attacks leaving limited safe-spots, the raid must be very careful where they slide.Horrid Roar- causes all members of the raid to drop AoE circles beneath their feet. Due to the thin-ice persisting at this point, all players will need to slide away from their own dropped circles (and try not to slide into other players circles in the process).Akh Rhal + Tail End- causes energy to erupt from beneath two random damage-dealers (in the form of multi-hitting AoE circles), followed by a vicious tank-buster against the primary target.Ambient Aether (H + Earthshaker + ?)- a combo used earlier in the battle, causing Midgardsormr to horizontally spin, then apply a mark to all raid participants. Once the second spin has been performed,Earth Shakerwill fire shock-waves in a line from Midgardsormr's center towards all marked players (at the same time as theAmbient Aetherattack). Try to have all participants surround Midgardsormr in a circular pattern so that no two players will be overlapped by upcoming shock-waves - and remember - if Midgardsormr flips horizontally, players will need to retreat from the boss to avoid a point-blank AoE, but if Midgardsormr flips vertically, all players will need to remain within Midgardsormr's hitbox to avoid the donut AoE. No matter which combo is performed,Earth Shakerwill conclude at the same time as that attack.Time Immemorial- causes Midgardsormr tore-applytheDeath from Above/Belowdebuffs. Midgardsormr will remain in aflyingstate, so no action is necessary unless the tank-debuffs are swapped. In short, theDeath from Above (Blue)tank must continue to avoid tanking the boss.Before entering an enraged state, Midgardsormr will perform one moreExaflare + Ice-Storm + Akh Morncombo, followed by an additionalAkh Mornenrage cast that hits substantially harder and continues until the raid wipes. Players should spread out to buy more time to DPS the boss while theAkh Mornkills off individual players.Loot30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsAlphascape Datalog v2.0Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityOmega Head Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Hand Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Foot Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityOmega Head Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Hand Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Foot Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
