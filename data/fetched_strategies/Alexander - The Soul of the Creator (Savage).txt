This deals high damage and must be pointed away from the party.Punishing Heat: A high damage tankbuster. The main tank needs to use heavy cooldowns to survive this. The boss will fire anotherDivine Spear.Blazing Scourge: Two random players are marked with red orbs, then are hit 3 times for high damage. Players need to separate to avoid overlapping damage.Incinerating Heat: A random healer will be marked with a stack marker. Players need to stack to mitigate the damage.Mega Holy: Raid-wide AoE. Mitigate and heal through.Gravitational Anomaly: Players will drop AoE markers that will grow. Players need to move out of these quickly and move towards the boss, which can fire one of two attacks:Radiant Sacrament: The boss fires a large donut AoE that can only be avoided by moving close to the boss. If hit, most players will die. It also debuffs withInfirmityandDamage Down.Sacrament: Fires line AoEs from the boss, can only be dodged on the diagonals of the boss's hitbox. If a player gets hit by this, they will most likely die. If not, they will be debuffed withInfirmityandDamage Down. The boss will fire anotherDivine Spearand aPunishing Heat.At this point the boss will disappear from the arena and ads will begin to spawn.Phase 2Wave 1:Arrhidaeus's Lanner: Two groups of these will spawn at the east and west. Pick these up, group them together and AoE them down.Wave 2:The General's Wing: These castAlmost Holyconstantly until deafeated. After each cast they will receive a stack ofMagic Damage Up. Focus on taking out two at a time to mitigate how many stacks the ads receive.Wave 3:The General's Time: This ad will have a large green circle underneath it that buffs the other ad that spawns withDamage Up. Have the off tank grab it and pull them apart. It will also useHalf Gravity, dealing high damage to the tank, and gaining a stack ofMagic Damage Upafter each cast.The General's Might: Will spawn close toThe General's Time. Have the main tank pull this ad away. It will castSmash, dealing high damage to the tank and receives a stackingPhysical Damage Upbuff after each hit.Divine JudgmentPlayers need to destroy all ads before the boss finishes casting this, otherwise it is a wipe. Even with all the ads dead, Tank players will still need to use a level 3 Limit Break to mitigate the attack enough to survive.Phase 3Chronofoil: The boss will return to the center of the arena and grow wings. The main tank should also provoke and establish enmity, as the enmity has reset for the boss.The boss will then follow up with aGravitational Anomalyand anotherSacrament, aDivine Spear,Punishing Heatand yet anotherDivine Spear.Temporal Stasis: Players will be completely frozen for about 8 seconds and hit by an attack. They will also receive specific debuffs that require players to participate in specific mechanics. Failure to do so will result in the death of the player:Defamation: Players will receive a massive AoE that must be moved away from the rest of the party to avoid. It also inflicts aMagic Vulnerability Updebuff, meaning a player can not be hit by more than one. It is recommended that players with this debuff move to the east, south and west.Shared Sentence: Players will need to stack with other players to split the damage of this attack in a small AoE, however they can not stack with another player that has this debuff, or the players that haveDefamation.Restraining Order: Two players will be tethered with a blue line, and both hit by a small AoE attack. Players tethered together must move as far away from each other as possible.House Arrest: Two players are tethered together with a red and green tether, and both will be hit by a small AoE. These players must stack close to each other.These debuffs can come out in any order and can target any player. Sometimes a player might not even receive a debuff. There are a few general rules that players can expect to follow to make this phase as easy as possible:Players withDefamationcan never stack, as theMagic Vulnerability Updebuff will cause the damage to kill them.Players withDefamationandShared Sentencecan never stack for the same reason.Players withShared Sentencecan not stack together for the same reason.If you have no debuff, pair up with theShared Sentenceplayer.Players with theRestraining Orderdebuff should move to opposite sides of the arena, or as far as possible if a player is a melee fighter.If all players have a debuff, theShared Sentenceplayers can stack with theRestraining Orderplayers.As long as players satisfy the requirements of their debuffs by the time the cast finishes, everyone will survive.Phase 4Time Gate: Four ads spawn that move into four time gates. The ads and time gates will always spawn in the same place:The General's Wingwill spawn in the northeast and northwest. One DPS player should enter each time gate to destroy the ads. They will castAlmost Holycontinuously until defeated.The General's Mightwill spawn in the southwest. The off tank should enter this time gate. The ad will castSmashuntil defeated. This ad deals high damage, so mitigate and self heal as needed.The General's Timewill spawn at the southeast. Send a healer into this time gate. The ad will castHalf Gravityand healers will need to heal through the damage.After an ad is defeated, that player will be able to move to another platform to help defeat the other ads. When all ads are destroyed, players will be returned to the arena. If the ads are not defeated within 60 seconds, the raid will wipe.Judgment Crystal: Random players are marked, and a crystal drops on them, dealing damage to the player as well as splash damage and leaves a point blank AoE. If the boss is near a crystal, it will castTetraShatterand explode in a proximity based AoE. It is recommended players drop the crystals on the edges of the platform at the intercardinals. The boss will fire various attacks during this, evade them as you did in the previous phases.Inception: The boss will disappear and reappear at one of eight locations on the arena. If the crystals were placed at the intercardinals, players can determine where it will reappear based on what crystal explodes. This is helpful as the boss will castSacramentimmediately upon respawning, allowing the party to move to safe locations at the boss's diagonals.The boss will castInceptionagain, this time debuffing players: 1Defamationdebuff, 1Shared Sentencedebuff, and 6 tethered players of either red & green or blue. Players will need to watch what crystal begins to explode to predict where the safe zones will be and group in them to satisfy the debuffs.
The debuffs always attach to the same players in the same order:The main tank will always receive theDefamation, the off tank will link to a DPS, a healer to a DPS, the other healer will getShared Sentence, and the final two DPS will link together. It is recommended that players group in the following way: The off tank, both healers, and the DPS withHouse Arrestmove to one zone, and the main tank and the DPS withRestraining Orderto the other. The two DPS that are linked together will move according to their tether. The boss will respawn and immediate fire, so if players are prepositioned properly, they should be safe.Phase 5Summon Alexander:Alexander Fortresswill spawn at the outer edge of the platform and will fire various attacks:Holy Bleed: High damage raid-wide AoE. The boss will glow blue. Mitigate and heal through.Communion: Players are targeted with lasers and drop 6 puddles. these puddles will debuff withBleedif stepped into, so players should drop these by the edge of the arena.Void of Repentance: Two puddles spawn around the arena. Players must soak them 3 times in order to get rid of them. If they are left alone, they will explode and deal raid-wide damage and debuff withInfirmityandBleed. When stepped into the puddles deal damage and inflictMagic Vulnerability UpandReduced Immunitydebuffs. Each soak will shrink the size of the puddle but increases the damage it deals per soak.The boss will then cycle through several attacks in a row,Incinerating Heat,Holy Bleed,Holy Scourge, a four-hit heavy damage tankbuster that needs to be mitigated through, and then aChastening Heatthat can either be tankswapped or the main tank can pop an invulnerability skill. Finally, the boss will useVoid of Repentanceagain.
This phase will repeat until either the boss is defeated or enrages and usesJudgment Protocolto wipe the party.LootSee also:Alexandrian WeaponsAlexandrian Manifesto - Page 4Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPaladin's Alexandrian Arms (IL 275)OtherN/ACBlue1Alexandrian Metal AxeMarauder's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal GuillotineDark Knight's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal SpearLancer's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal KnucklesPugilist's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal KatanaSamurai's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal DaggersRogue's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal BowArcher's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal CannonMachinist's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal RodTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal GrimoireArcanist's Grimoire275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal RapierRed Mage's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal CodexScholar's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Metal MeterAstrologian's Arm275CBlue1Alexandrian Chest Gear Coffer (IL 270)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAlexandrian Weapon Coffer (IL 275)OtherN/AABasic1Toy AlexanderMinionN/AABasic1Arrhidaeus Master KeyOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchSins of the Savage Creator I5CompleteAlexander (Savage).-3.4Sins of the Savage Creator II10CompleteAlexander (Savage)5 times.-3.4Sins of the Savage Creator III20CompleteAlexander (Savage)10 times.-3.4Mightier than the Prime5CompleteAlexander - The Soul of the Creator (Savage)with a party of onlyblue mages,Silence Echoturned on, andUnrestricted Partyturned off.-5.15RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
