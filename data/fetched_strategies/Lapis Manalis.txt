Increased sightings of voidsent in the area lend further credence to your suspicions. In the hopes of narrowing your search for the alleged gate, Alphinaud tells you of an abandoned village in the mountains to the east where Garleans once practiced the reaper arts.

A portion of the east or west wall will begin to have moving snow, telegraphing where a herd of animals will charge through the room as a line AoE that hits around a third of the arena. The system message "Another rumbling can be heard in the distance..." will then appear, and an animal herd will charge down another third of the room based on the telegraph. Anyone hit by the charging animals will be inflicted withConcussionand receive damage-over-time.Albion's Embrace: Telegraphed tankbusterLeft Slam / Right Slam: The boss will use a half-room cleave to the left or right of its hitbox, based on the name of the attack. Has only a brief AoE indicator.Knock on Ice: The boss summons three chunks of ice, telegraphed by red AoEs.Icebreaker: The boss faces one ice chunk, tethers it, and targets with a orange reticle. It will use a large circular AoE (with only a brief indicator) that destroys the rock.Icy Throes(no cast bar): The boss marks everyone with an AoE telegraph so the party should spread. Two more ice chunks will also spawn.Roar of Albion: A roomwide AoE that can be dodged by hiding behind an ice chunk from the boss.Galatea MagnaWaxing Cycle: The boss will use a large, telegraphed point-blank AoE, immediately followed by a very briefly telegraphed donut AoE that hits the previously safe area. Anyone hit by this attack or the next one will be inflicted withSustained Damage.Waning Cycle: The boss will use a large, telegraphed donut AoE, immediately followed by a very briefly telegraphed donut AoE that hits the previously safe area.Soul Scythe: The boss will face a random cardinal, then jump to it and perform a large, briefly telegraphed, circular AoE in the direction it was facing.Soul Nebula: Unavoidable roomwide damage that also spawns will summon two portals to the boss's east and west. This is followed byScarecrow Chase. Each portal will have a number of dots over it (1 or 2), indicating in which order the boss will teleport to them and use a briefly telegraphed cross AoE that hits the intercardinals of the portals. Anyone hit will be inflicted withDoomthat must be cleansed withEsunato prevent death. This first set can be dodged by remaining in the center of the room.Tenebrism: Gives everyone theGlassy-eyeddebuff. Four meteor circles will sequentially spawn around the boss and must be soaked by at least one player to prevent them from exploding and dealing party-wide damage. When the last tower is about to be soaked, gaze indicators will appear above everyone, indicating that theirGlassy-eyeddebuff will resolve soon. Everyone must look away from each other or they will be inflicted withPetrification.Soul Nebula / Scarecrow Chase(version 2): Functions similarly as before, except the boss will start on the edge of the arena and summon four portals, one in the middle, and three in the other edges.Notes:Depending on how quickly the party kills the boss, it will give a different line of dialogue upon its defeat and rank the party's performance from 1 to 12, with a lower number being a faster kill time. This appears to be purely cosmetic and does not impact rewards.An average party in the Duty Finder will typically receive a rank of 7.The top rank of 1 requires a kill time of less than 90 seconds (at level 90, a premade party of 3+ DPS in item level 630-635 best-in-slot gear, food, tinctures, full resource openers, party buff alignment, and strong burst damage is typically needed to achieve this).IfZerois in the party as aDuty SupportNPC, it will also give a different line of dialogue upon its defeat.Drowned King:CagnazzoShortly after engaging the boss, the arena will be surrounded by an AoE that will inflictDropsyand deal damage-over-time to anyone who steps in it.Stygian Deluge: Unavoidable party-wide damage.Antediluvian: Spawns three sets of two bubbles across the arena, which will grow in size. When a bubble reaches maximum size, it will drop down as a large circular AoE with a brief indicator. The boss will also spawn a purple knockback AoE in the middle (Body Slam), which will kill anyone inside the AoE telegraph. This knockback cannot be prevented with knockback immune actions.Hydraulic Ram: The boss will sequentially telegraph several line charge and circle AoEs which will disappear after a short time. It will then use AoE attacks in the order of the telegraphs.Hydrofall: Telegraphed stack AoE.Cursed Tide: The boss assigns various debuffs to players and becomes untargetable.Neap Tide: A point-blank AoE on the afflicted player when the debuff expires. Three players will receive this.Spring Tide:  A stack AoE on the afflicted player when the debuff expires. One player will receive this.The boss will spawn four immobileFearsome Flotsamwhich must be defeated beforeCagnazzo's Powerreaches 100, or the party will wipe.The party's debuffs will resolve, but they will be telegraphed with standard AoE indicators for several seconds before they resolve.Several telegraphed circular AoEs will also spawn.Tsunami: Party-wide damage after the adds phase. Heal through and mitigate.Voidcleaver: Four portals will spawn, each tethering to one player. These will periodically spawn telegraphed conal AoEs in the direction of the tethered player.Lifescleaver: Multiple telegraphed conal AoEs originating from the boss.Void Torrent: Line AoE tankbuster.LootSee also:Manalis ArmorandManalis AccessoriesAlbionNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBattledance Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Heavens' Eye Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Manalis Chapeau of

assaults from outside tribes have markedly increased of late. The Geraldines proved an especially barbarous thorn in our sides, their nigh ceaseless pillaging no doubt an effort to hoard supplies in preparation for the coming winter.No longer able to tolerate the damages suffered by these incursions, the senate issued an order for their king's assassination, and we reapers were asked to ready our blades.With three of her fellows in tow, Galatea set out under cover of night and infiltrated the enemy fortress. Their mission was a great success which soon put the enemy to rout.— Dated RecordsFaded Records“Emperor Solus is convinced this magitek will spark a revolution in warfare as we know it. And as he devotes further resources to its advancement, our arts continue to fall out of favor. I fear the age of the reaper has come to an end.After all our forebears have sacrificed for the good of the Empire. The blood spilled, the lives lost. They would dare deem us relics of a bygone era.
Indeed, they believe the future lies with their “reaper” battle armor.— Faded RecordsTrainee Warning Notice“Aspirants are reminded not to approach the figures of the Pale Harvest without express permission. They should be treated with no less reverence than Galatea herself, and are hardly less dangerous.Only those who have successfully forged a pact with an avatar may spar with the Galatea Parva. They will serve to refine one's use of invocations and tactical coordination.The Galatea Magna, however, is reserved for those who are able to serve as host to their avatar. This periculous manikin is designed to push a reaper to their limits, if not beyond them.Learn to walk in death's shadow, and you shall know no fear.— Trainee Warning NoticeDollmaster's Memorandum“Maintenance of the Galateae must be handled with the utmost of care. The delicate art of their making has long since been lost, making repairs difficult, and reproduction all but impossible.The knowledge was kept secret, passed down to those who would inherit the position of master dollmaker. That is, until one man chose to break with tradition.He claimed to be leaving on a journey in pursuit of an “unparalleled beauty,” but we never learned the truth of it. The only thing that is certain, is the art of our forebears left with him.— Dollmaster's MemorandumGalatea Magna Evaluation Rankings“<creak> Evaluation complete.An equal toDrusilla.
