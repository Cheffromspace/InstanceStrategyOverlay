(Similar to Dragon's Voice fromCutter's Cry).When Rangda places the Prey debuff on you, run to one of the tall pillars encircling the room to transfer it.Kill adds as they spawn.GyascutusProximity Pyre: A close-range circle attack centered on the boss.Ashen Ouroboros: A donut attack around the edge of the room.Inflammable Fumes: Whenever this is cast, an unsafe ring will appear around the area. Be sure not to step in this area. there will be circles of fume spinning around the boss, which can be safely stepped in at first. The boss will then cast eitherAshen OuroborosorProximity Pyre, causing the fume circles will explode at the same time as the donut or circle attack, so find a safe place where you are not in the circles of fume and not in the other attack marker.Crippling Blow: TankbusterDeafening Bellow: Unavoidable raidwide damageBody Slam: Knocks all players back from the center of the area. Make sure to stand near the center to avoid being knocked back into the unsafe ring around the area, or use a knockback prevention move such as Arm's Length, Surecast, etc.NidhoggWithpatch 6.2,Estinienis no longer present within the battle as an NPC, so the focus should be entirely on defeating Nidhogg.Deafening Bellow: Unavoidable raidwide damageHot Tail: A line attack across the length of the area in the direction that Nidhogg is facing.Hot Wing: Two line attacks on each side of the area under Nidhogg's wings.This andHot Tailare sometimes accompanied by Nidhogg spawning eyeball-shaped circle markers under random players. Move out of these circles to avoid taking damage from them.Cauterize: Nidhogg will leave the arena and cast a fiery line attack across the length of the platform. Move out of the attack to avoid damage.Horrid Roar: Nidhogg will also leave a circle marker on each player, who should also spread out to avoid overlapping.The Scarlet Price: TankbusterThe Sable Price: Nidhogg will trap a random player within the Sable Price, which beginsSable Weaveto kill them if not destroyed in time.Massacre: At around 50% HP, Nidhogg leaves the arena, summons several dragon adds, and begins charging up aNidhogg's Rancorgauge.

Infographic Part 3LoreNidhogg's LairIn a bygone age, when man and dragon yet abided in harmony, upon this site there stood a castle where the honored kings of men dwelled. This ended, however, when the great wyrm Nidhogg, laid it to waste in retribution for his brood-sister Ratatoskr’s murder. Thereafter, upon the castle’s ruins the wyrm made his lair, and there he would return every few decades to slumber and regain strength for his unending war on mankind.That he might rest undisturbed, Nidhogg shrouds the Aery in vicious storms—an intimidating show of the power wielded by one of the First Brood. Further protecting his domain are fierce and loyal minions, who stand guard over areas whose names are rooted in a burning hatred for mankind, such as Ten Oohr and Erm Scorh, which may be translated as “depravity’s heart” and “man’s sin” respectively.GyascutusGyascutus served Nidhogg as seneschal, using his arcane mastery to preside over other dragons in the maintenance of the Aery. Adapted for ambulation and bereft of flight, he had not set foot off the Aery for centuries, and thus was unknown to Ishgardian authorities, never appearing on the Vault's extensive list of draconian menaces.NidhoggOne of the seven great wyrms and leader of the Dravanian Horde, Nidhogg and his minions tormented the Holy See for a thousand years in the bloody conflict known as the Dragonsong War. Despite losing his eyes, the source of a dragon's might, he still possessed ample strength to easily destroy Ishgard. That he refrained from the act was solely because he craved not the enemy’s destruction, but their eternal punishment. In a twist of irony, however, he would be undone by his own eye, borne by the Azure Dragoon Estinien, who stormed the Aery with the Warrior of Light at his side. At the end of a ferocious struggle, the dread wyrm was laid low, vanishing from sight into the depths of the Churning Mists.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
