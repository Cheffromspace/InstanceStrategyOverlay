And now smoke rises from its iron crenellations. In a bid to drag the armies of Eorzea into the struggle for Ala Mhigan liberation, the Griffin and his Resistance fighters have disguised themselves in Grand Company uniforms and laid siege to Baelsar's Wall. While Alphinaud seeks to call your companions back from their now-meaningless mission of diplomacy, you must ascend the war-torn fortification by the swiftest route possible and persuade the Griffin-by force, if necessary-to abandon his reckless ambition.— In-game descriptionBaelsar's Wallis a level 60dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.5withHeavensward.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Magitek Predator3.2Armored Weapon3.3The Griffin4Loot4.1Magitek Predator4.2Armored Weapon4.3The Griffin4.4Additional Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 10.9 Y: 11.5) Outer Reaches4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 10.5 Y: 9.6) The Walk4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 11.6 Y: 10.8) The Walk4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 12.0 Y: 11.9) The Walk5Achievements6Images6.1Gear Images6.2Dungeon Images7Lore7.1Steel Separating The Forest7.2Armored Weapon7.3The Griffin7.4MoreDuty SupportScion MarauderScion ConjurerScion ThaumaturgeScion LancerClassMarauderConjurerThaumaturgeLancerRoleTankHealerDPSDPSObjectivesImperial identification keys: 0Clear all barricades. 0/1Defeat themagitek predator. 0/1Slay all the imperial defenders. 0/1Defeat thearmored weapon. 0/1Clear the parapet. 0/1Defeatthe Griffin. 0/1BossesBaelsar's Wall Dungeon GuideMagitek PredatorMagitek ClawTargeted attack on Tank.Magitek RayLinear high-damage attack.Magitek MissileTargeted high-damage explosion on marked players.Move away from others when marked with Magitek Missile.

Wall.-3.5ImagesGear ImagesDungeon ImagesLoreSteel Separating The ForestBaelsar’s Wall is an imposing structure which divides the Black Shroud and Gyr Abania. Built at the orders of the legatus Gaius van Baelsar as a means to contain lands corrupted by primal influence, the wall’s center is dominated by the defensive stronghold of Castrum Oriens. The facilities within have been augmented numerous times, with engineers outfitting magitek workshops with production line capabilities, and accelerating manufacture of the “slasher” model warmachina.Disguised in Grand Company uniforms, it was against this fortification that the Griffin and his Masks would launch an assault, and force a chain of events leading to Ala Mhigo’s liberation. When cornered atop the wall by Eorzea’s champion and the Scions, the Griffin did the unthinkable, draining Nidhogg’s eyes and sacrificing his own life in the final step of a summoning ritual. His actions culminated in the manifestation of the primal Shinryu, and forever skewed the course of the ensuing war to free Ala Mhigo.Armored WeaponConstructed within the Wall’s manufacturing facilities, the armored weapon was designed around vanguard technology, allowing the machine to be either piloted or autonomous in combat. As its autonomous functions were limited to simple orders such as “destroy all targets,” however, the unpiloted weapon was ill-suited to operations requiring any degree of subtlety.The GriffinThis firebrand leader who seized the reins of the Ala Mhigan Resistance was later revealed as Ilberd Feare, former captain of the Crystal Braves. Through his dealings with the Ascians, the Griffin acquired the eyes of Nidhogg and drew upon their immeasurable energies to perform a primal summoning. He leapt to his death to complete the ritual, dragging down with him into oblivion the answers to a great many questions.MoreAs well as presenting an imposing physical barrier, Baelsar’s Wall was built as a magitek factory and production line. Industrial cranes and other mechanical conveyances were also installed to facilitate the transport of large numbers of warmachina.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
