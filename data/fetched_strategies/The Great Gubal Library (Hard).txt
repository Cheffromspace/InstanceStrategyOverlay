With danger at every turn, the fool who dares trespass here would find not wisdom but certain doom. Yet it was not long ago that an intrepid adventurer braved the deepest depths of this forbidding vault of knowledge, returning unscathed and wiser for the experience─a feat of daring that would be sung of the realm over. Mayhap that is why an anonymous individual would beseech that selfsame champion to return in search of long-forgotten knowledge. One can only hope this venture proves yet another enlightening lesson.— In-game descriptionThe Great Gubal Library (Hard)is a level 60dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.4withHeavensward.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Demon of the Tome2.2Liquid Flame2.3Strix3Loot3.1Demon of the Tome3.2Liquid Flame3.3Strix3.4Additional Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 14.5 Y: 12.5)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 16.1 Y: 13.1)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 9.5 Y: 10.1)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 10.5 Y: 10.8)4Achievements5Images5.1Gear Images5.2Dungeon Images6Lore6.1The Boy and the Dragon Gay6.2Of Loves Unrequited6.3Over the Horizon Redux6.4On the Culinary Applications of Coblyns6.5Proceedings of the Council of Magi6.6The Boy and the Dragon Gay: A Literary Analysis7DialogueObjectivesArrive in the Hall of Magicks.Clear the Hall of Magicks.Arrive in the Astrology and Astromancy Camera.Clear the Astrology and Astromancy Camera.Arrive in the Rare Tomes Room.DefeatStrix.BossesDemonSlayerGaming1 Video GuideMrHappy1227 Video GuideMTQcapture Video GuideDemon of the TomeBest to tank it sideways so that all the AoE indicators are visible. Otherwise, the fight is mainly a positioning check. Watch out for narrow AoE markers at the edge of the arena; a large AoE attack will follow in between them.Liquid FlameBibliocide: Unavoidable party-wide AoE for moderate damage.Sea of Flames: Scorched earth AoE attack, much like Ifrit's.Slosh: A random player gets tethered to the boss; it will shortly charge at them; the player has to run far away from the boss.Important mechanics:Ferrofluid: Players get + and - marks, if your mark is the same as the boss's, run close to the boss. Otherwise, run away.Seal of Night and Day: Players get sun and moon marks; run to the corresponding sun or moon sigil on the floor.StrixCheck Out: Spawns a set of circles for resolving upcoming mechanics.White circle: While standing in it, grants Levitation to resolveQuakes.Black circle: While standing in it, inflictsLeadento resolveTornados.Green circle: Togglesimpstatus. If you are not an imp, inflicts 20s of Imp andLightning Resistance Down II; if you are, cleanses those debuffs. Imps cannot use any actions.On the Properties of Quakes: Raidwide. Damages anyone without Levitation,Stunningthem for 3s and inflicting a 30sVulnerability Upstack.On the Properties of Tornados: Hits each player with a tornado AoE. If you don't haveLeaden, each tornado you're clipped by deals damage, knocks you into the air, and inflicting a 30sVulnerability Upstack.TheLeadencheck snapshots when the damage happens, not when the castbar ends! Don't leave the circle too early.On the Properties of Imps: Toggles everyone's imp status.The imp check snapshots when the castbar ends, but there is a delay before debuffs actually get changed. You should wait until you get turned into an imp before stepping in the circle. If you instead step in right after the castbar ends, you will just get turned into an imp twice.On the Properties of Thunder III: Marks everyone with a purple marker, then hits each of them with an AoE. Used after On the Properties of Imps. If you are still an imp, each AoE you're clipped by deals more damage due to theLightning Resistance Down II, and inflictsDown for the Countfor 5s and a 30sVulnerability Upstack. If you areSprinting, you will get knocked into the air.On the Properties of Darkness: Mini TB.On the Properties of Darkness II: Raidwide.The first Check Out spawns 4 white circles. The second Check Out spawns 2 black and 2 green circles. The boss will only use attacks that can be resolved using the currently available circles.1min 40s into the fight, the boss will go to boss north and cast Check Out again. This time, it spawns an untargetableBehemoth Wardthat slowly casts Ecliptic Meteor. 2 consecutive proximity AoEs will occur, with a rock dropping on each location. Avoid being too close to the proximity AoEs, but don't run too far either, as you will need to hide behind a rock before Ecliptic Meteor goes off. Ensure a rock is between you and Behemoth (like inThe Labyrinth of the Ancients), or you will take massive damage (kills squishies).With modern gear creep and decent dps (if players don't mess up the previous mechanics), you will kill the boss before or during the Ecliptic Meteor cast, meaning you can ignore it and burn the boss down.After resolving Ecliptic Meteor, the fourth Check Out spawns 1 of each circle.LootSee also:Valkyrie ArmorandValkyrie AccessoriesDemon of the Tome15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityValkyrie's Boots of AimingFeet225BGreen1Valkyrie's Boots

play in the forest with his pet chocobo. But the forests were fraught with peril, and one day, a band of brigands ambushed the boy, spiriting him away to the harsh mountains of the north.Yet there be dragons there, and as they rode up the mountain path, one of those majestic beasts came swooping down from the heavens. The boy's chocobo reared in fright, sending the boy tumbling down the mountainside to his nigh-certain demise.And yet the gods saw fit to spare his life, if only meagerly so. As he lay there, battered and broken, all manner of foul beasts drew near, threatening to rip him limb from limb. Just as the boy was making his peace with the Twelve, another dragon appeared. A smaller creature, yes, but even a small dragon is a fearsome opponent indeed.It was then that the strangest thing happened. With a mighty roar, the dragon turned upon the circling beasts and spit forth a burst of flames that reduced them to so much ash, saving the poor boy's life. With what half seemed a smile, the dragon approached the wounded child and gently raised him up to sit upon his back, and the two flew off to the gods know where.— The Boy and the Dragon GayOf Loves Unrequited“Oh, but why must the gods curse me so! By what cruel trick of fate was I given this oversized, ungainly body and sent into this world whereyouabide─my princess, my goddess, my everything!Your delicate hands, your shapely head, your dark eyes in which I would lose myself and never return! Yes, every aspect of your being strikes me to depths of the heart I knew not I had until the day you first appeared before me.And yet, I am a Roegadyn. Could one of your kind ever love a lumbering brute such as me?Good sense tells me that the answer is no, but my heart─nay, my verysoulwill not accept it! For bereft of your company, I fear I will wither away into a wretched husk of what was once a man.O, have mercy on this poor soul, my goddess! Pray grace me with your presence when next your travels call you to Limsa.My beloved Brayflox, just say the word and I am yours forever!— Of Loves UnrequitedOver the Horizon Redux“It is widely known that the Mamool Ja boast one of the most impressive indigenous societies to be found in the New World. It would be a mistake, however, to view the Mamool Ja as a single, uniform people.A careful analysis of documents brought back by explorers reveals that the Mamool Ja are more accurately described as a federation or alliance of numerous distantly related tribes, each with distinguishing physical characteristics: the brown-scaled Hoobigo with their distinctively long combs, the large-eyed, blue-scaled Boonewa, and the mottled Doppro.It is further said that although Mamool Ja rarely marry outside their own tribes, such unions do occur on the occasion of certain religious observances, and are known to produce two-headed offspring that are hailed as “blessed siblings” and groomed to be warlords from a young age. Indeed, the Autarch, ruler of all Mamool Ja kind, is known to be one of them...— Over the Horizon ReduxOn the Culinary Applications of Coblyns““From mutton to morel, oyster to orobon, eel to eft—Eorzea does not want for delicious and delightful ingredients to stimulate the senses of any culinarian.And yet how is it that we came to know that the flesh of these creatures would pleasure our palate so? The answer is self-evident: for every familiar ingredient, someone, at some point in our history, first took it upon him or herself to eat it!And yet this answer raises another question: what wondrous flavors and textures remain undiscovered, just waiting for a brave soul to discover them? And so it was that I took it upon myself to investigate the culinary suitability of coblynflesh! Why coblyns, you ask? To which I say, good reader, whynotcoblyns!”The above passage was composed by my elder brother. Sadly, they were the last words he ever wrote, for—as he soon discovered—coblyn feelers are poisonous.

One day a band of ruffians came and spirited the boy away, seeking to deliver him to a slave trader in hopes of earning some coin.No sooner had they left the village than they were set upon by a great dragon. Down from the heavens it swooped, tearing the blackguards limb from limb and charring their carcasses with hellsfire.But it was by no mere chance that the great wyrm had found them, no! The boy had befriended the great wyrm some time ago, and it had sensed the danger to its dear friend.Alas, in the chaos, the boy had tumbled from the mountains, and lay half-dying at the base of the cliff. Seeing its dear friend lying there, battered and beaten, the dragon gave unto the child of its blood.So it was that the boy took to the skies as the wyrm's minion, flying off to only the gods know where...— The Boy and the Dragon Gay: A Literary AnalysisDialogueStrix:You are unwelcome here.
