What she does not realize, however, it that something else -something sinister- has also made the lush forest its home. Now driven from their rightful(?) claim, Brayflox and her brethren seek to retake the land, and are not above asking the help of lesser races (that would be you) to help them do so.— In-game descriptionBrayflox's Longstopis a level 32dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.

Aiatar has a tankbuster indicated by a red marker over the tank. During the fight, the dragon will spit small AoEs around the room that will form green rocks; the rocks' AoEs will expand and explode rather quickly so find a safe spot where there is no rock. After a couple rounds, there will be secondary green rocks which should be avoided after the first sets explode. Aiatar will also do a line AoE in the direction he faces, so be sure to position him away from the party.Healerscan useEsunato cure poison from any party member.BestiaryNameDropsAiatarAshdrakeBlue BackComet ChaserDeep Jungle CoeurlGreat Yellow PelicanGully GalagoHellbenderInferno DrakeNameDropsMud BiastPainted ColibriRaveled RaincatcherSable BackSurf EftPeculiar LightSwamp PugilViolet BackWyrmhoundLootSee also:Longstop Weapons,Longstop ArmorandLongstop AccessoriesGreat Yellow PelicanNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityLongstop ArquebusMachinist's Arm34BGreen1Longstop BaselardsRogue's Arm34BGreen1Longstop BowArcher's Arm34BGreen1Longstop CrookTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm34BGreen1Longstop GlobeAstrologian's Arm34BGreen1Longstop GreatswordDark Knight's Arm34BGreen1Longstop GrimoireArcanist's Grimoire34BGreen1Longstop HoraPugilist's Arm34BGreen1Longstop LabrysMarauder's Arm34BGreen1Longstop LanceLancer's Arm34BGreen1Longstop PoleTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm34BGreen1Paladin's Longstop Arms (Lv. 32)OtherN/ABGreen1Inferno DrakeNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBattlemage's GlovesHands34BGreen1Battlemage's HatHead34BGreen1Cavalry GauntletsHands34BGreen1Cavalry MaskHead34BGreen1Infantry BandanaHead34BGreen1Infantry GlovesHands34BGreen1HellbenderNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBattlemage's BreechesLegs34BGreen1Battlemage's RobeBody34BGreen1Cavalry CuirassBody34BGreen1Cavalry TrousersLegs34BGreen1Infantry ShirtBody34BGreen1Infantry SkirtLegs34BGreen1AiatarNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBattlemage's CrakowsFeet34BGreen1Cavalry SabatonsFeet34BGreen1Infantry ThighbootsFeet34BGreen1Lipflaps on Longstops Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Longstop ArquebusMachinist's Arm34BGreen1Longstop BaselardsRogue's Arm34BGreen1Longstop BowArcher's Arm34BGreen1Longstop CrookTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm34BGreen1Longstop GlobeAstrologian's Arm34BGreen1Longstop GreatswordDark Knight's Arm34BGreen1Longstop GrimoireArcanist's Grimoire34BGreen1Longstop HoraPugilist's Arm34BGreen1Longstop LabrysMarauder's Arm34BGreen1Longstop LanceLancer's Arm34BGreen1Longstop PoleTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm34BGreen1Paladin's Longstop Arms (Lv. 32)OtherN/ABGreen1Treasure CoffersThe additional chests require savingGoblinNPCs tucked around the map at various locations.

As tends to happen, Brayflox inadvertently did what one must never, ever do: wake the dragon. Thus did a massive, menacing shadow fall over the Longstop, whose denizens were forced to flee with little more than the gobbiebags upon their backs. Loath to give up their amassed riches, painstakingly acquired during their wanderings, the goblins plotted to take back the Longstop, and they would drag into their brazen plan an adventurer who had come to the settlement on unrelated business.AiatarWounded some decades ago by a dragoon’s lance, this creature of Nidhogg’s Horde made its way from northern Coerthas to the island of Vylbrand, where it entered into a deep sleep of healing. It ought to come as no surprise, then, that the dragon was in a bad mood when Brayflox and her crew arrived. They chose Raincatcher Gully as a retreat so that it might feed upon the jungle's poisonous vegetation to imbue its breath with virulence.The Goblin Cheese WarWith the dragon Aiatar vanquished, Brayflox’s Longstop knew peace once more. But that peace was not to last, for trouble soon visited again in the form of the Illuminati, a secretive fraternity of goblin scholars. Deploying their armored unit, they set about laying siege to the settlement, and in desperation Brayflox turned once more to her trusty uplander friend. Never one to forsake those in need, the adventurer proceeded to deal with the enemy, striking them down to the last goblin...only to learn that the blame for the invasion in fact lay with Brayflox, who absconded with a jealously guarded tome bearing a secret cheese recipe. That being said, the heavy-handed means the Illuminati employed to achieve their ends were also questionable, and one need not strain to imagine the unease the adventurer must have felt to be caught amidst this dispute.Gobmachine G-VIDeveloped by the Illuminati, this war vehicle was originally designed for construction and repurposed for destruction. While it lacks the refinement of imperial machines, boasting stout plating and a powerful ceruleum engine, it is regarded as a feat of goblin engineering in its  own right.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
