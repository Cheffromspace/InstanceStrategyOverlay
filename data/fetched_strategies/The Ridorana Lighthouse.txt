Whether you believe the cataract natural wonder or demon-torn gate to the very underworld, journeys to her edge should be made with that utmost caution, seeing as none who have stumbled into the darkness have ever returned to tell their tale. An ancient spire once used by the Dalmascans as a lighthouse rises defiantly above the churning waters to warn forethoughtful and foolhardy alike. It is into this spire that the transformed Ba'Gamnan has fled. It is into this hell that you must follow.— In-game descriptionThe Ridorana Lighthouseis a level 70raidintroduced inpatch 4.3withStormblood.

Damage to all players inside the AoE.Tsunami:AoE knockback, followed by Famfrit charging its amphora with water (visual effect) and releasing a large cone-shaped AoE. This deals massive damage and repeated knockback toward the edge of the arena, which is also a damage zone. It's possible to escape withSurecastor the like, but very difficult even then, so try to avoid it entirely. Famfrit will do this more than once. The visual of the amphora will indicate the direction of the AoE.Dark Ewer:Famfrit spawns a number of amphorae, that will downpour and move around. Getting hit by any of it will result in medium damage.Dark Rain:A number of AoE circles will be placed around the arena.Darkening Rainfall:Famfrit spawns three (or more, later into the fight)Dark Rainadds. ExpectWater IVshortly after the spawn. Having failed to kill all adds may result in several dead players or even a wipe.Dark Cannonade:Players are marked with red triangle. After a short time players will be tossed into the air and take moderate damage. Grouping together negates the toss and reduces the damage -- you only need to group with one other marked player! More doesn't hurt, but don't put in extra effort just to make a larger stack.AddDark Rain:Blob-like add. Must be killed in about 30 seconds. If not killed in time, it will castExplosionand deal significant arena-wide damage and inflict one stack ofMagic Vulnerability Up.Belias, the GigasBelias may split in two. Both will charge in a linear fashion. Note the arrow marker. Both Belias will charge to such a marker and from it in the direction of the arrow. The Belias will stop for about 3 seconds at such a marker. Getting hit by the charge will deal damage and inflict one stack ofVulnerability UpandSlow. It might be prudent to stand in the centre tile and move from there if necessary.
In general, expect to be inflicted byVulnerability Upif you fail to avoid an avoidable damaging ability.AbilitiesFire:Prepare forFire IV.Fire IV:Arena-wide AoE, significant damage.Time Eruption:Places nine rectangle shaped AoEs. The AoEs look like clock faces, with fast or slow spinning hands. Fast spinning will explode first, slower second.The Hand of Time:Standing marker, tethered to players. After a short grace period, tethered players suffer Burn and Slow (more stacks the closer they are) and any player who contacts the tether suffers Stop.Rise, loyal minions. Heed my call!:Summons threeGigas. ChargesManameter as long as the adds are alive. If they're near each other, they tether and gainVulnerability Down, so tanks need to spread them apart.Hellfire:Ultimate. Damage according to the chargedManameter.Time Bomb:Places four meteor markers. Clockwork hand will indicate the direction of the AoE, which can be rotated 90 degrees by having a player step into the circle. The hand will not rotate if a player is already standing in the circle, and the impact itself does not deal damage. Getting hit will inflictVulnerability Up.AddGigas:Mob has proximity shield that lowers damage suffered. It is necessary to pull them away from Belias and each other.Construct 7“A wise artithmetican once said the primes were the most lonesome of numbers. To that I say bollocks! 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 31 ... and so on to eternity. There are enough digits here to start a fellowship!— Crude Scrawling at (X:10.5, Y:13.8)Construct 7 has two modes:Annihilation Mode- it will use its normal damage abilities. It starts in this mode.Computation Mode- it will execute a mathematical examination but will do nothing otherwise. See further down.AbilitiesDestroy:Tankbuster.Accelerate:Places large AoE circles under some players. Marks one player with astack marker.Pulverize:Circular AoE around Construct 7, then four additional circle AoEs beneath random players. Followed byCompress.Compress:Linear AoE from Construct 7 in a random direction. Later in the fight, this will be X-shaped linear AoEs.The construct cogs begin to whirr.:Places six AoE circles (cog wheels like, later blue). Construct 7 will charge the arena in a linear fashion. Places AoE circles under players and finally places a meteor arena-wide AoE in the centre of the arena.Lithobrake:Meteor AoE inThe construct cogs begin to whirr.phase. Damage according to proximity to centre of the AoE.Dispose:Medium sized cone-shaped AoE (approximately 45° wide) shortly afterLithobrake. Construct 7 will jump to the centre of the arena and start using this ability, rotating clockwise or counterclockwise as it charges (which indicates the rotation Construct 7 will be doing during the execution).Be very wary of this ability. It is lethal.Further,Damage Downwill be inflicted on a hit. It is suggested that playersrushto Construct 7 afterLithobrakeand stay at its back at all time duringDispose. While Construct 7 is glowing red, he rotates faster and fires off more attacks.If you do get caught by Dispose, runintothe direction of rotation. This will ensure you do not get hit more than once by letting Construct 7 rotate away from you, rather than trying to outrun him.Computation Mode:This is a minigame phase. Player health is set to a single digit value. This is the base value for the mathematical operation. Stepping into one of the circles (1, 2, 3, 4) will add the respective value to the health of the player. The player is asked to step into a circle so that the player health, plus, possibly, the value of that circle, can be divided by a given number. Sometimes stepping into such a circle is not required, if the player health already fulfills the equation. Failure will apply one (1) stack ofComputation Error. Success will apply one (1) stack ofComputation Boost. Construct 7 will follow up withIncinerateafter this phase, making it very important for healers to top off the raid as soon as theSubtractdebuff ends.Subtract:Preparation forComputation Mode. Set player health to a single digit value. The player's health remains a single digit after the debuff wears off.Divide by Four:Step into one of the circles, so that the value of your current health plus the value of the circle (1 - 4) can be divided by four.Divide by Five:Step into one of the circles, so that the value of your current health plus the value of the circle (1 - 4) can be divided by five.Divide by Three:Step into one of the circles, so that the value of your current health plus the value of the circle (1 - 4) can be divided by three.Indivisible:Step into one of the circles, so that the value of your current health plus the value of the circle (1 - 4) is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13). 1is not a prime number!Tartarean Protocol Loaded:Add phase. Kill theConstruct 7.1in time and step into the bluish orb in between the three arenas. Failure will result in the death of the player in this arena.Incinerate:Arena-wide AoE.Ventilate:Minor damage and knockback around Construct 7. Seems to have no real significance other than indicating that Construct 7's rotation is repeating.AddConstruct 7.1:Depending on your alliance, each Construct 7.1 performs a different mechanic.Alliance A: Marks players with + and - polarity, and tethers each player. If tethered to a player with the same polarity, get close. If tethered to a player with opposite polarity, get as far away from each other as possible.Alliance B: Missiles will spawn on the sides of the arena. Avoid them to prevent any unnecessary explosive damage.Alliance C: UsesAcceleration Bomb. Same as Ozma, dice-like debuff icon. Do not move or act in any way once the countdown (4s) is finished.YiazmatYiazmat starts the fight with a greatly inflated HP due to hisThe One Dragonbuff - his actual HP is 20% of that shown prior to the ultimate phase.AbilitiesThe One Dragon:A permanent buff on Yiazmat that drastically increases his maximum HP. Yiazmat begins the fight with this status buff, and it is only removed once the raid destroys theHeart of the Dragon.Rake:Tankbuster. In addition to the cast bar, Yiazmat telegraphs this ability by shouting "I'll tear you limb from limb!".Stone Breath:Yiazmat turns away from the tank and stands on his hind legs. A cone shaped AoE in the direction Yiazmat is facing will follow shortly after this animation. Being hit inflictsVulnerability UpandPetrification. Yiazmat telegraphs this ability by shouting "Escape this!".Dust Storm:Arena wide AoE, medium damage. Yiazmat telegraphs this ability by shouting "Agony and sorrow!".White Breath:Yiazmat breathes icy breath around the entire platform, dealing heavy damage and inflictingSlow. The only safe zone is within Yiazmat's hitbox. Yiazmat telegraphs this ability by shouting "Your suffering is not yet over.".Magnetic Lysis:Marks player with +/-, divides arena into +/- zones. Players should stay in the opposite zone of the player mark. Yiazmat telegraphs this ability by shouting "You will not know mercy!"Magnetic Lysis +: Signified by two reddish + signs around the player. Stay on the bluish ground.Magnetic Lysis -: Signified by two bluish - signs around the player. Stay on the reddish ground.Dust Stormwill follow and deal more damage if the player is raised up from the ground, i.e. not in the correct half of the arena.Being on the same-colour side of the field inflicts a levitation debuff. Theonlyway to remove this debuff is to step onto the opposite-colour side -- if Magnetic Lysis ends, the debuff will remain! (SeeCyclonefor why this is bad.)Rake (Version 2):An arrow marker is placed on the ground. Yiazmat will charge to the arrow marker slowly and then continue to charge around the arena. Getting hit by Yiazmat will deal significant damage and inflictDamage Down. Yiazmat telegraphs this ability by shouting "Like a knife through butter!".Summon:Summons threeWind Azers, which will tether to 3 random players and shoot column AoEs in their direction. Yiazmat telegraphs the summoning by shouting "Your pain is my pleasure!".Cyclone:AoE whirling all players around, significant damage. Group should be above 50% health. If a player has the floating debuff fromMagnetic Lysiswhen this attack executes, they will be thrown out of the arena, resulting in instant death. Yiazmat telegraphs this ability by moving the center of the arena and shouting "Feel the wrath of my brothers!".First time will be the prelude to the ultimate phase. Spawns threeArchaeodemons shortly after the players are on the ground again. The spawnpoints are in a triangle around Yiazmat. The first is right at the entrance, number two and three are in the north north west and north north east quadrant. As long as theArchaeodemons are alive, theManameter will be charged. If the threeArchaeodemons are dead, theHeart of the Dragonbecomes available, which must be destroyed before theManameter fills. Yiazmat begins this phase by moving to the center of the arena and shouting "You will pay for what you have done...with blood!".Second time will be followed byDeath Strike.Solar Storm:Ultimate. At fully chargedManameter, this will deal 300,000 points of damage. Can be reduced by shields, though.  Anything above a 75% chargedManameter will be some serious damage. Yiazmat shouts "Scream louder! I want to remember this!" as the ability is cast.Death Strike:Stack markeron a player. Yiazmat telegraphs this ability by shouting "Armageddon will deliver the king's justice!".Growing Threat:Damage Upbuff on Yiazmat, also making him glow orange. Yiazmat telegraphs this ability by shouting "My wounds...give me strength!".AddWind Azer:Tether with one player. UsesAncient Aero- line shaped AoE in the direction of the tethered player.Archaeodemon:Summoned in ultimate phase. Must be killed in time to destroy the dragon's heart and end this phase. If two of them are close to each other, both will be buffed withInvulnerability.AbilitiesKarma:Large, cone-shaped AoE.Unholy Darkness:Circular AoE, placed under player.Heart of the Dragon:Must be killed to end the ultimate phase. It might be prudent to use any LB available. Destroying this also removes Yiazmat'sThe One Dragonbuff, greatly reducing his max HP.LootSee also:Ivalician Armor (iLvl 360)Famfrit, the Darkening Cloud10Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityIvalician Archer's BootsFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Archer's HeadbandHead360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's MonocleHead360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's ShoesFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's GreavesFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's HelmHead360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's MonocleHead360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's ShoesFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's BandanaHead360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's GreavesFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's BootsFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's HeadbandHead360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's BandanaHead360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's GreavesFeet360CBlue1Belias, the Gigas20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityIvalician Archer's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Archer's GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's GauntletsHands360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's Fingerless GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's TrousersLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's Fingerless GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's TrousersLegs360CBlue1Construct 730Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityIvalician Archer's BootsFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Archer's JacketBody360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's RobeBody360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's ShoesFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's GreavesFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's SurcoatBody360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's RobeBody360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's ShoesFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's GreavesFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's JacketBody360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's BootsFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's JacketBody360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's GreavesFeet360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's JacketBody360CBlue1Yiazmat40Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityIvalician Archer's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Archer's GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Archer's HeadbandHead360CBlue1Ivalician Archer's JacketBody360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's MonocleHead360CBlue1Ivalician Arithmetician's RobeBody360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's GauntletsHands360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's HelmHead360CBlue1Ivalician Ark Knight's SurcoatBody360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's MonocleHead360CBlue1Ivalician Chemist's RobeBody360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's BandanaHead360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's Fingerless GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's JacketBody360CBlue1Ivalician Shikari's TrousersLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's BottomsLegs360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's HeadbandHead360CBlue1Ivalician Thief's JacketBody360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's BandanaHead360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's Fingerless GlovesHands360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's JacketBody360CBlue1Ivalician Uhlan's TrousersLegs360CBlue1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityConstruct 8MinionN/AABasic1Yiazmat CardTriple Triad CardN/A1The Mystery of Giruvegan Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Apoplexy Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Flash of Steel Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1RewardsWhen originally released, players could receive only one gear reward per week for completing duties in the Ridorana Lighthouse.
