The "Goddess," as she was simply known, graced the souls of her worshipers with perfect equilibrium, binding their disparate societies in gilded chains of harmony. In the present day, she is better known asSophia, one of the incalculably powerful eikons of theWarring Triad. And after five thousand years of imprisonment, her failed plans for vengeance once more threaten to come to fruition. Defeat the wakened thralls and slay the stirring Goddess, lest her divine "balance" bring all the world to equal ruin!— In-game descriptionContainment Bay P1T6is a level 60trialintroduced inpatch 3.4withHeavensward.Contents1Strategy1.1The Goddess: Sophia1.2Phase 11.3Phase 21.4Phase 32Loot3ImagesStrategyThe Goddess:SophiaSophia utilizes the following moves and mechanics throughout a total of three phases.Updated Shadowbringers GuideSophia (Normal) GuidePhase 1The fight begins withThunder II, a large conal AoE aimed in the direction that Sophia is facing, immediately followed byThunder III.Thunder IIIis a giant donut AoE emitted from Sophia with a safe spot just inside her hitbox. If players are far enough away, it can also be avoided by standing at max-range, depending on Sophia's position.Players must also be wary ofAero II, a large AoE centred on Sophia that deals moderate damage and inflicts a knockback. While neither fatal nor particularly difficult to avoid, players should respect this mechanic later in the fight seeing as the rails on the side of the arena will eventually collapse, allowing players to fall out of the arena to their deaths.Daughter, the lower-half of Sophia, will occasionally disappear from beneath her and materialize at the edges of the arena. After doing so, it will charge up and fire a straight line-AoE calledLight Dewacross the platform.Sophia Rushis much like theDaughterattack used by her lower half. Sophia herself will move to the eastern or western edge of the arena and charge a huge straight line-AoE across the platform that must be avoided.Sophia will eventually createProximity Markersunder the feet of players that they must move away from to avoid as much damage as possible.Phase 2Sophia begins this phase by castingCloudy Heavens, making herself invulnerable and marking all players withEternal Doom. This debuff can only be cleared by defeating three adds.If players are fatally injured while affected byEternal Doom, they will become mindless zombies, attacking their fellow teammates with no control over their actions.The First Demiurgeis a Paladin-based add that utilizes AoE attacks and a directional parry. Players who attack the wrong side during the parry-mechanic will be knocked away. Ideally, this add should be focused last.The Second Demiurgeis a Healer-based add which will heal the other adds and also uses a gaze mechanic to confuse any players looking directly at it. Ideally, this add should be slain first.The Third Demiurgeis a Lancer-based add that will eventually drop a persistent ice puddle on the ground at its current position. Ideally, this add should be positioned at the side of the arena to prevent the puddle from being too obstructive during Phase 3 and the rest of the current add-phase.Phase 3For the most part, Phase 3 is very similar to Phase 1, apart from a few new additions.From here on, it will now be possible to fall off the platform, though players that do so for any reason can still be resurrected after a brief delay.Sophia will eventually useQuasar, which creates tethers to the east and west of the platform. Each of these tethers will spawn ameteorthat will slowly fall towards a set of scales on both sides of the platform. Players must determine which side of the arena is safe by calculating the 'weight' of the meteors and moving to the side that weighs the least. On collision, the arena will tilt towards the side that weighs the most and send players sliding in that direction. The larger the weight-difference, the further players will slide.There are two types ofMeteorsthat help calculate the tilt.Orange Meteorshave a value of 1 and can appear on both sides of the arena.Blue Meteorshave a value of 3 and will only appear on one side.The best approach to this mechanic is to always move towards the opposite side of anyBlue Meteorsand stand at the very edge before the arena tilts.Players must also be mindful of the ice puddle left behind byThe Third Demirugeduring Phase 2. Before the scales tip, it is best to position yourself so that you don't slide through the puddle.Sophia will occasionally castSin & Punishment, placing a white ring around two players and a dark blue ring around two other players. To avoid high damage and debuffs, each affected player must stack with one player with anopposite colour.Lastly, when Sophia reaches 15% health or less, she will spawn anotherSecond Demiruge(healer-add) with the same abilities from Phase 2. However, despite being a healer, it cannot heal the boss. Depending on overall DPS, the group must decide between nuking the add to reduce the threat of its gaze attack, or have the off-tank move it away while the group focuses on Sophia to end the fight.Loot15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsSophia Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)ImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
