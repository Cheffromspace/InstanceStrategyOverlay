When the house's digging uncovered an entrance to the void, allowing an army of voidsent into this realm, however, they immediately abandoned their plans and withdrew from the subterrane, sealing it off so that they might contain the otherworldly invaders within. Despite all this, the house is unwilling to relinquish its claim to the caves, and believes that if they can be cleared of voidsent, they might still be able to see their original plan brought to fruition.— In-game descriptionDzemael Darkholdis a level 44dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.

Some of them will be within range of the orange crystal AoEs, so heal through the damage. Having more people in the timers makes them faster, but with diminishing returns--they take 20 seconds with one person, 10s with two or three, and 7.5 with four.BossesDzemael Darkhold GuideAll-seeing EyeAll-seeing Eye is the first boss of Dzemael Darkhold.

Batraal will mark a player with a crosshair and fires Desolation at the target every few seconds. While Batraal is connected to the crystal, he is invulnerable. Be sure to kill the crystal as soon as possible while dodging Desolations. The player who was targeted should avoid aiming the Desolations at the rest of the party.At around 30% HP and after the 3rd crystal is destroyed, Batraal will use Hellssend and become enraged.

When the house's digging uncovered an entrance to the void, allowing an army of voidsent into this realm, however, they were forced to withdraw from the subterrane and suspend their plans. To add insult to injury, imperial troops exploited the confusion to take up positions within the caves.In a bid to liberate the Darkhold, a young Artorel de Fortemps assembled his knights at the hamlet of Owl's Nest. Bolstered by the presence of capable adventurers, they succeeded in removing the Garleans, earning the future lord of House Fortemps considerable renown. The voidsent, however, proved considerably more difficult to purge, and after some years at a standstill, the call went out once more for brave souls who might aid in reclaiming the caves once and for all.All-seeing EyeAn immense ahriman whose menacing eye seems to strip barethe essence of things. With but a mere gaze it can call down a curse upon its enemies, while its robust wards stymie the efforts of archers, sending their arrows skittering harmlessly away.BatraalIn the course of the Darkhold's construction, the workers of House Dzemael uncovered solid, to their sheer horror, what turned out to be a full gargoyle. A type of voidsent that manifests in the Source by merging its essence with stone, the creature is believed to have occupied a position of power amongst its kind, as indicated by the pair of massive blades it brandished. In gargoyle society, such as we understand it, size does appear to matter.Himself a student of architecture, Count Tarresson de Dzemael had hoped to minimize the cost of building a fortress by taking advantage of a natural cave system. The myriad troubles that beset the Darkhold's construction, however, led to his renouncing his title—under pressure from his sons, if the whisperings amongst Ishgardian nobility are to be believed.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
