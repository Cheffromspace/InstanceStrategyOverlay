The arena is initially a 4x4 square grid, which is important for some mechanics.Katarraktes: Raidwide damage and bleeding damage-over-time.Rheognosis: Summons an untargetable clone of the boss which will go to the east or west side of the room, above the water. After a lengthy animation, it will use a briefly telegraphed knockback, so go to the wall towards the clone to avoid being knocked off, or use knockback immunity.Thlipsis: Stack marker on random player.Left Bank / Right Bank: A half-room cleave based on the attack name or which side the glowing orb is located. Has a very brief AoE indicator.Hydroptosis: Spread markers on random players. InflictsWater Resistance Down, making overlap lethal.Rhyton: Line AoE tankbusters targeting all 3 tanks, or whoever is top enmity if not all tanks are alive.Tetraktys: Transforms the arena into a triangle, with a dangerous AoE surrounding it.

The walls of the tower will fall down from where they are facing as briefly telegraphed line AoEs. This attack repeats, but now two towers will spawn, and both will collapse at the same time, leaving a smaller safe area.Rheognosis Petrine: Summons the same knockback clone as inRheognosis, but two spheres of water will charge through two rows in the arena. Anyone hit by these will beStunned.Hieroglyphika: Covers all but two tiles of the arena with a green AoE telegraph. The boss will also telegraph either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation, indicating what direction the safe tiles will be rotated by 90 degrees. Players should stand on a tile that will be safe after the rotation. All players will be inflicted withInscribed, preventing them from moving after the debuff expires, until the AoEs resolve.This attack is then repeated, but the boss will also slowly castLeft BankorRight Bank. Players should resolve the rotating AoEs, then find the safe half the room. One of the safe tiles should also be safe from the half-room cleave, but there is enough time to adjust from the other one as well.TetraktysandTetraktuos Kosmosare used again, but are slightly faster this time.LlymlaenNote that the arena is surrounded by a wall of damaging water.Tempest: Raidwide damage.Seafoam Spiral: Telegraphed donut AoE.Wind Rose: A point-blank AoE with only a brief ground indicator.Navigator's Trident: Telegraphs a left cleave then a right cleave (or vice versa) then uses those attacks.This is followed by a telegraphed lethal line AoE through the middle, with knockbacks to both sides of the AoE. This knockback can be prevented with knockback immune. The line AoE will also a reveal an additional long segment of the arena that becomes relevant soon.Surging Wave: A purple knockback circle spawns, which will kill anyone inside it. Everyone else will be knocked back a great distance and should position to be knocked into the long passageway. This knockback cannot be prevented. There will be a narrow green indicator designating the correct spot to stand in. The knockback will brieflystun the party.The water at the back of the passageway will begin closing in, so players must quickly run back to the main arena. Anyone caught in the torrent will die. Meanwhile, the passageway will contain several water sphere (Sea-foam) that should be avoided.Left Strait / Right Strait: A half-room cleave based on the attack name. Has no AoE indicator.Deep Dive: Stack marker on a random player.Torrential Tridents: Sequentially summons sixTridents. Each one will do light raidwide damage (Landing) will appear. Tridents will do large point-blank AoEs in the order they appeared, so start at the last trident, and move into the first explosion.Afterwards, the boss will spawn circle AoEs under random players and mark others with spread telegraphs. Dodge and spread accordingly.Denizens of the Deep: The boss will summon two untargetable adds (PerykosandThalaos) to assist with the rest of the battle.Wind Roseis used again, but the adds will do line AoEs each covering a third of the arena at the same time. These are telegraphed by the white splashing water on the outside.The adds will telegraph two more line AoEs, leaving a third of the arena safe, while the boss castsLeft Strait / Right Strait. This is followed by two more line AoEs perpendicular to each other, and multiple baited circle AoEs on players.Godsbane: Raidwide damage that inflictsDropsydamage-over-time.Navigator's Tridentis used again, but the adds will also telegraph perpendicular line AoEs during the knockback. Position to be knocked back safely (or use knockback resist) while avoiding the wide line AoEs.Surging Waveis used again, but instead of dodgingSea-foamadds, the boss will telegraph three half-room cleaves (To the Last) that should be dodged while running back to the main room.Deep Diveis used again but the adds present (Hard Water), and now is a 3-hit stack AoE.Navigator's Dagger: Later in the fight, if a player uses the emotesBlow Kiss,Hug, orDoteon the boss when she is not casting an action, she will face them, say "Oi, cut it out, you!", and hit them for massive damage with a strong knockback.[1]OschonNote that the arena is surrounded by a dangerous AoE.Phase 1Sudden Downpour: Raidwide damage.Trek Shot: The boss telegraphs a wide frontal cone AoE along with an area that he will jump to and face before firing the AoE. Move to the wall with the arrow telegraph to dodge.Reproduce: Summons an untargetableOschon's Avataradd. The add will useSwinging Draw, which is very similar toTrek Shotand can be dodged in the same way. This attack repeats once.Flinted Foehn: Multi-hit stack AoE.Soaring Minuet: 270 degree frontal cleave from the boss. Only has a brief AoE indicator.The Arrow: Telegraphed AoE tankbusters on all three tanks.Reproduceis used again but now summons two clones. Dodge in the corner of the room between the two arrow telegraphs.Downhill: Summons several circle AoE telegraphs. This is used withClimbing Shot, a knockback from the middle. Position to be knocked back to a safe area, or use knockback resist. (Soaring Minuetis used after, so knockback resist will require less movement.)Phase 2Lofty Peaks: The boss will become untargetable and emit four hits of light raidwide damage. The party will be flung to a new arena and the boss will transform to a much larger form and recover all his health. It is now possible to fall off the edge of the arena.Piton Pull: The boss places a hook on two quadrants of the arena, telegraphing massive circular AoEs with only a brief indicator. Move to a corner without a hook to dodge.Altitude: Several green circle AoE telegraphs will briefly appear and disappear. The AoEs will resolve a few seconds later.Flinted Foehn: Functions as before.Wandering Shot: The boss will summon two green arrow telegraphs converging on a blue circle. This indicates the origin of a massive circular AoE. Anyone hit will be knocked up.The Arrow: Similar tankbusters as before but the AoEs are much larger.Arrow Trail: Arrows will travel down several columns in the arena, telegraphed by red areas. Move into a safe area once the arrows pass by. This is combined with baited circle AoEs on random players.Downhill: Spawns several circle AoEs at the edge of the arena, leaving some gaps. This is combined withWandering Volley, consisting of a horizontal knockback from the middle and the massive AoE telegraph inWandering Shot. Position to be knocked back into a safe area, or use knockback resist.The Twelve:EulogiaNote that players can fall off the arena to their death.Dawn of Time: Raidwide damage.First Form: The boss spawns a blue arrow telegraph from where it is currently located, along with an orange arm telegraph on one of its sides. The blue arrows indicate where the boss will move to and face, and the orange arms telegraph a left or right side cleave from where it is facing after it moves to the end of the arrow.Second Form: Similar toFirst Form, but the second blue arrow originates from where the first ended.Third Form: Similar toFirst Form, but the third blue arrow originates from where the second ended.Quintessence: The boss will move to the end of the first arrow, use its previously telegraphed left/right cleave, and continue for the remaining two arrows. To dodge these, players will need to remember the AoE telegraphs and keep in mind that the cleaves are relative to where the boss is now facing.This series of attacks is then used again. The boss also introduces a new telegraph, a circle of rotating hands on its back, which indicates a donut AoE. Players should follow the boss closely as it moves and dodge inside its hitbox.Sunbeam: Telegraphed AoE tankbusters on all 3 tanks.The Whorl: Raidwide damage that transitions the arena. There is now an AoE at the edge that will instantly kill anyone who touches it.For the majority of the fight, the boss will use mechanics from all previous bosses in theMyths of the Realmraid series.Love's Light(Menphina): Summons four adjacent moons at the edge of the arena, each with an increasing "phase". Each moon will begin to wax (become more filled) and use a large line AoE (First Blush) through the middle once they are full. The party can dodge these by rotating clockwise or counterclockwise.Solar Fans(Azeyma): Two fans will start from the boss and move to opposite walls with a line AoE trailing behind them.The fans will repeatedly move 90 degrees around the edge of the arena, leaving an arc AoE trailing them.Radiant Finish: Both fans will explode in two massive circle AoEs. Once they start moving, players need to quickly move towards the cardinal directions without the fans.Hydrostasis(Nymeia): Summons three water puddles numbered 1-3, indicating the original order in which a ball of water will drop on them, inflicting a knockback from the puddle's location.Time and Tide(Althyk): Tetherstether theHydrostasispuddle numbered 3, causing it to resolve first. The puddle previously numbered 1 will resolve second, followed by the one previously numbered as 2.Arm's LengthandSurecastcan be used to mitigate two of the three knockbacks if timed properly. Otherwise, players should aim their knockback to the next puddle to resolve to avoid being knocked into the wall.Destructive Bolt: Stack marker on random player.Hieroglyphika(Thaliak): Spawns a 4x4 grid of green AoE telegraphs, with two empty tiles. The boss will also telegraph either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation, indicating what direction the safe tiles will be rotated by 90 degrees. Players should stand on a tile that will be safe after the rotation. All players will be inflicted withInscribed, preventing them from moving after the debuff expires, until the AoEs resolve.Hand of the Destroyer(Rhalgr): When the tiles are still rotating, two colored portals will appear, splitting the arena in two. The boss will pull back one of its hands and prepare to punch one colored portal, hitting the same colored half with a massive fist AoE, knocking back anyone hit. This resolves a few seconds afterHieroglyphika.Matron's Breath(Nophica): Summons a blue circle and yellow circle on the arena, followed by four beacons that are either blue or yellow. Each beacon will have a shrinking circle and a number of dots, indicating when it will resolve. Standing in the circles will inflict eitherBlooming BlueorBlooming Golddepending on the color.

Each one will do light raidwide damage (Landing) will appear. Tridents will do large point-blank AoEs in the order they appeared, so start at the last trident, and move into the first explosion.Byregot's Strike(Byregot): Knockback from a random point around the middle of the arena. The blue center itself deals lethal damage. This attack is combined withByregot's Strike. Around the boss will sprout 4 thin conal lightning AoEs. They will not start from the boss's current position but will be translated into the center of the Byregot's Strike's knockback circle.Thousandfold Thrust(Halone): Several red targeting circles will appear around the boss. They will then converge into a single one and spread out, indicating where the boss will use a 180 degree multi-hit cleave.As Above, So Below(Nald'thal): Unavoidable raidwide damage that transitions the arena. A line of alternating color traveling AoEs. These will beorangeorblue. Only the AoEs the same color as the ewers surrounding the boss or the background sky will be real, while the other color's indicators are fake.

Here rest explorers and adventurers, mountain climbers, saints and those who rescued the aforementioned souls from peril.— The Hell and Heaven of Wind,Encyclopædia EorzeaVolume I, p. 19“Every god and goddess of the Twelve is associated with one of the six controlling elements. When the deities deemed Their work on Eorzea complete, They proceeded to create the firmament, the result being six astrally aligned heavens aspected to each of the six elements, and a final seventh heaven to rule them all. However, a residual product of these heavens were six similarly aspected hells, ruled by an all-encompassing, umbrally aligned seventh hell. The six "lower heavens" are represented in the sky by six constellations—star formations which astrologians also perceive as gates that, when opened, can allow a person to become attuned with the heavens and manipulate their aether. These constellations revolve around the pole star which is believed to be the gate to the seventh and final heaven.— Hells and Heavens,Encyclopædia EorzeaVolume I, p. 19TriviaThe background text during the battle with Thaliak, when the arena is a triangle, has the following[2]:Light in darknessHeat in the coldFluid yet solidTempestuous calmProsper in strifeIn death, live onReferences↑https://twitter.com/Kiershar/status/1713058945055494193↑2024 Japanese Fanfest Panel:https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/151558839005741056/1193417506426195978/IMG_0149.png?ex=65aca3aa&is=659a2eaa&hm=76e3f1b96f96a3d964a9190ba9423010e858eb79f971205767765deb926d56db&RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
