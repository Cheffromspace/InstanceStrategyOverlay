It is level 89item level560CBluegear with IL sync.Players should be aware that stepping in any of the puddles on the ground in thePestilent Sandsor theGrebuloff Pillarswill debuff them with a potent poison Damage over Time debuff calledToxicosis, which deals about 10,000 damage per second until they step out.Note that failing any mechanics in these fights will result in the player who failed them receiving a two minute stackingVulnerability Updebuff.Caustic GrebuloffMiasmata: Roomwide AoE that additionally spawns AoE circles around the arena. These AoEs will move across the arena in the direction of the wind, so players must position themselves to avoid them. If hit, a player will receive theNecrosisdebuff, which must be cleansed withEsunaorThe Warden's Paean, or it will kill them if the debuff timer expires.Cough Up: Drops 3 sets of AoEs on each player, spread apart to avoid overlapping. After the AoE circles players will receive a red arrow above their head and theCraven Companionshipdebuff. Players must be stacked when the debuff timer expires or they will be inflicted withHysteriafor several seconds.Wave of Nausea: A telegraphed donut AoE around the boss. Being hit will inflictNecrosis.Pox Flail: Tankbuster.Blighted Water: Stack marker.Befoulment: Targeted AoE circles, spread to avoid overlap.PeacekeeperDecimation: Raid-wide AoE that also covers the outer part of the arena in fire. Contacting it will inflictBurns, dealing damage-over-time.Electromagnetic Repellant: The boss summons a field that fills its hitbox, that debuffs players withElectrocutionand deals damage as long as they stand in it.Order To Fire: Spawns a number of turrets around the boss, which then shoot line AoEs directly outward from the boss.  The line AoEs converge at the edge of the boss's hitbox, leaving narrow cone safe-zones between the line AoEs between the boss's hitbox and the edge of the arena. Usually combined with a targeted AoE, so spread to avoid overlapping.No Future: Spawns a pattern of targeting circles, which will hit every area of the arena at some point.  Stand in areas that don't yet have targeting circles, or ones that spawned later, then move into ones that just exploded.  This attack has two patterns: the AoEs will spawn under the boss and move outwards, or will start from outside the arena and move inwards. The hitbox under the boss is never a safe zone, so players should avoid standing there. If the AoEs spawn from the edge inward, players can identify the safe space and move into it. If they spawn from the center of the arena, players can stand at the point where the AoEs overlap, as the next ones to spawn will spawn outward from the first and not be touching. The attack will fire two sets of circles on the first time, and three sets per cast from the second cast onward.  Each successive cast is rotated such that the areas that were initially safe in the prior cast are now targeting circles, requiring players to adjust their positioning.Peacefire: Spawns AoEs that will keep rotating around the boss, avoid by rotating with the AoEs.  Always cast alongsideElectromagnetic Repellant, forcing players to stand in the area the circles rotate through.  This can be cast alongsideOrder To Fire, requiring the players to find a position ahead of the rotating AoEs and within the narrow cone safe zones.Eclipsing Exhaust: Spawns AoE circles around the edges, with several gaps between them, then triggers a telegraphed knockback from the center of the room.  Get knocked into a gap.Elimination: Tankbuster. The boss fires a wide beam that will hit other players if they are too close, almost certainly killing them.The Last Mercy:Ra-laWarm Glow: Raid-wide AoE.Pity: Tankbuster.Prance: Boss jumps 4 times, dealing no damage, but dropping golden circular zones that will grow, then explode in the order they were spawned in.  Move into one of the last two circles, then move into where the first circle was after it explodes.Lifesbreath: The boss jumps to the edge of the arena, then shoots a line AoEs through the middle.  After the line AoE, a line of butterflies will spawn in the same location, facing one half of the arena in alternating pairs. (⬆⬆⬇⬇⬆⬆⬇⬇ etc...)  After a short delay, the butterflies will fire a line AoE (Lamellar Light) in the direction they are facing.  Players must position themselves behind a butterfly to avoid the attack.  Note that you can move through the line of butterflies before they fire. If hit by the butterflies players will receiveDoomand must be healed up to full health to recover, or they will die.  The second cast of this is accompanied byLoving Embrace, making one half of the arena unsafe to stand on. Loving Embrace fires off slightlyafterthe butterflies' attack, allowing melee DPS to swap sides if necessary.Benevolence: Stack marker.Loving Embrace: The boss will raise a glowing wing, then cleave that entire side of the stage from the middle of its hitbox outwards. Move to the other side to avoid.Still Embrace: Targeted AoE circles, spread to avoid overlapping.LootCaustic GrebuloffNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityThe Last Earring of AimingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of CastingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of FendingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of HealingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of SlayingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Necklace of AimingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of CastingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of FendingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of HealingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of SlayingNecklace560BGreen1PeacekeeperNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBattledance Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Heavens' Eye Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Piety Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Quickarm Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Quicktongue Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Savage Aim Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Savage Might Materia IXMateria560ABasic1The Last Bracelet of AimingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of CastingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of FendingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of HealingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of SlayingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Ring of AimingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of CastingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of FendingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of HealingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of SlayingRing560BGreen1The Last Mercy:Ra-laNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityOf Countless Stars Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1StarbirdMinionN/AABasic1The Last Earring of AimingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of CastingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of FendingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of HealingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of SlayingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Necklace of AimingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of CastingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of FendingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of HealingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of SlayingNecklace560BGreen1Treasure CoffersTreasure Coffer 1 (X:11.6 Y:12.8)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantitySavage Aim Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Savage Might Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Heavens' Eye Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Quickarm Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Quicktongue Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Battledance Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Piety Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Treasure Coffer 2 (X:10.3 Y:9.3)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityThe Last Bracelet of FendingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of SlayingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of AimingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of CastingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of HealingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Ring of FendingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of SlayingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of AimingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of CastingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of HealingRing560BGreen1Treasure Coffer 3 (X:11.2 Y:11.8)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityThe Last Earring of FendingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of SlayingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of AimingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of CastingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Earring of HealingEarrings560BGreen1The Last Necklace of FendingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of SlayingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of AimingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of CastingNecklace560BGreen1The Last Necklace of HealingNecklace560BGreen1Savage Aim Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Savage Might Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Heavens' Eye Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Quickarm Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Quicktongue Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Battledance Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Piety Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Treasure Coffer 4 (X:9.3 Y:9.3)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityThe Last Bracelet of FendingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of SlayingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of AimingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of CastingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Bracelet of HealingBracelets560BGreen1The Last Ring of FendingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of SlayingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of AimingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of CastingRing560BGreen1The Last Ring of HealingRing560BGreen1Savage Aim Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Savage Might Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Heavens' Eye Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Quickarm Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Quicktongue Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Battledance Materia IXMateria560ABasic1Piety Materia IXMateria560ABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: The Dead Ends10Discover every location withinthe Dead Ends.-6.0ImagesGear ImagesDungeon ImagesOther ImagesDungeon Dialogue Infographic Part 1 (credits:TrustInsighters)Dungeon Dialogue Infographic Part 2Dungeon Dialogue Infographic Part 3LoreLong-Forgotten Seashell“Why do you ask such a question? Do you not see the plague and pestilence that consumes us? Ours is a world of rancid blood and rotting flesh, where death is the only remedy to suffering. There is no meaning to be found in such misery.But it was not always thus... Beneath the waves we knew only peace and plenty. We wanted for naught, and yet craved more, that our progeny might someday flourish as we never could. Eventually we ventured to the lands above bearing flame and iron, toppling any who dared oppose our might.The world was ours for the taking.— Long-Forgotten Seashell #1Long-Forgotten Seashell“The world is not the boundless paradise we were promised.Our population quickly outstripped the habitable land, while seas we thought would shine forever blue ran dry, spoiled in forging the tools of conquest. Cramped homes turned to squalor, and then came the sickness.Our undoing--and the final blessing this star has to offer.We are no longer the fools we once were. Wheresoever life goes, death will follow. Indeed, existence is but the most painful path unto nothingness--and the wise embrace their obliteration wholeheartedly.— Long-Forgotten Seashell #2Long-Forgotten Correspondence“That otherworldly beings should first grace us with their presence is a sign. Indeed, they understand that we--the Global Community--are possessed of the wisdom and compassion needed to guide this star back to the path of righteousness!Yet the Freedom Fighters dare to undermine us, inviting chaos to disrupt the order we labored so hard to build. They have forgotten the history of this star and its once myriad nations. The wars waged, the countless lives lost...They must be brought to heel, the world united under a single standard, no matter the cost.— Long-Forgotten Correspondence #1Long-Forgotten Correspondence“We constructed the Peacekeeper, the pinnacle of engineering and technology. This mighty war machine was designed to rid us of the Freedom Fighters, as well as any other potential threats to the peace we have so long pined for.Its artificial intelligence ensures that this singular function is carried out with cold and calculating precision. Indeed, the 10,000 Peacekeeper units we created have now routed every threat to peace...including us. All that remains is to stand and fight.— Long-Forgotten Correspondence #2Long-Forgotten Essence“A curious traveler visited our star─a bird which proffered these questions: “What meaning does life hold? For what do you strive?”
I could find no satisfactory answers, only bittersweet memories of an age long past.There was a time when we were lesser, and in our nescience sought purpose─struggled to justify life's worth. That was, of course, before we achieved perfection. Now, condemned to our paradise, we understand the fatuity of existence.Like the fledglings we once were, the poor bird could not accept the truth. It asked us again and again─hoping, perhaps, our answer might change.— Long-Forgotten Essence #1Long-Forgotten Essence“There was a time when we yearned to explore the heavens, found purpose in the hope of unveiling life's mysteries. A dream shattered when we reached enlightenment, and found it empty.There was a time when we believed in our legacy, thought ourselves marking a worthy path our successors might follow. Efforts rendered futile when we discovered the keys to paradise and immortality.As individuals we struggled to know what was right, yet in today's perfect unity there is naught left to question. We are infinity constricted by the finite, but no more─Ra-la shall grant us the mercy of annihilation.— Long-Forgotten Essence #2DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
