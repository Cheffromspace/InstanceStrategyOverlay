And so it falls to you and yours to face the legendary auspice in battle─to quell the madness within and save his soul!— In-game descriptionThe Jade Stoais a level 70trialintroduced inpatch 4.2withStormblood.Contents1Strategy1.1Auspice: Byakko1.2Phase 11.3Free-Fall Transition1.4Phase 22Loot3ImagesStrategyThe Jade Stoa (Byakko) Primal GuideAuspice:ByakkoPlayers will enter a circular arena and witness Byakko's transformation from a White Tiger into a more humanoid form. The outer edges of the arena are safe during the first and second phase, but not during theFree-Fall Phasein-between.Phase 1Below are a list of Byakko's abilities (in the order they are used during the encounter).Storm Pulse- causes Byakko to blast the raid with unavoidable damage.Heavenly Strike- a vicious tank-buster against Byakko's primary target that should be mitigated via cooldowns whenever possible.State Of Shock- causes Byakko to lunge towards a random target and scoop them up in his tiger-fist. Shortly afterward, a stack-marker will appear within the arena, indicating where Byakko will slam the grabbed target. Teammates should make an effort to stand within the stack-mark location to help soak the slam, as failure to do so will lead to victim being slain.Sweep Of The Leg- Byakko prepares to kick all players in-front and beside him via a frontal-cone AoE that covers the entire platform, except for a safe cone directly behind him. Simply move behind Byakko as soon as possible to avoid tremendous damage. Bear in mind thatSweep Of The Legwill always happen directly afterState Of Shock.Unrelenting Anguish- Byakko teleports to the arena centre and begins to emit patterns of outward-travelling red orbs that all raid participants must avoid. Melee players must be especially careful as they will be extremely close to where the orbs spawn, though they do travel very slowly and can still be avoided.  DuringUnrelenting Anguish, Byakko will unleash multiple casts ofFire & Lightning.Fire & Lightning- a massive straight-line AoE aimed at a random player that everyone must avoid. Initially, Byakko will execute multiple casts at the arena centre, forcing players to avoid massive AoE's and the orbs at the same time. Eventually, Byakko will leap to the outer-edge of the arena and cast anotherFire & Lightningwhile the remaining orbs begin to expire.Hakutei- having successfully avoided the onslaught, players will witness Byakko leap from the arena while Hakutei - the White Tiger usually connected to Byakko's own arm - enters the fray. Hakutei is a mini-boss that must be picked up by a tank and turned away from the group. If not done so, players risk being swiped by Hakutei's vicious cleave attacks. Whilst dealing with Hakutei, players will also have to dodge AoE attacks that bombard the arena, leaving behind persistent puddles that inflict bleed on anyone who remains within them.White Herald- causes Hakutei to leap from the arena and place a proximity marker (flare) on its primary target. After a delay, Hakutei will inflict heavy damage by slamming down onto the marked player. Unmarked players must move away from the marked player beforehand to avoid taking too much proximity damage from the AoE slam.Fire & Lightning- executed immediately afterWhite Herald. On landing, Hakutei will charge a straight-line AoE towards a random player, forcing the raid to move out of the way to avoid damage.On reaching this point, Hakutei will leap to the arena centre and begin to chargeRoar Of Thunder, indicating the arrival of the next phase. However, the damage inflicted byRoar Of Thunderwill depend on how much health Hakutei has remaining, so players must burn down Hakutei as fast as possible to avoid tremendous damage (or a potential wipe). Survivors will be stunned and eventually launched high into the air, indicating the arrival of the next phase.Free-Fall TransitionAfter being launched into the air, the raid will begin free-falling. No actions (e.g. attacks or healing) can be performed at this time. During the phase, the outer ring of the arena will kill any player who touches it. Additionally, Byakko will begin firing orbs from far below which players must avoid. Periodically, Byakko will leap up and cast a doughnut AoE which must be avoided by moving into the centre. Lastly, Hakutei (the White Tiger) will occasionally cast a straight line AoE through the centre, forcing players to move out.Should you survive the onslaught, the raid will land (stunned) in a new arena be blasted with a massive unavoidable AoE attack from Byakko, killing any player who took too much damage during the free-fall.Phase 2Hundredfold Havoc- a set of outward-firing AoE lightning patterns that are telegraphed by an arrow icon, displaying the direction they will travel from Byakko (arena centre). Two patterns will be fired simultaneously (the second being slightly delayed), giving players enough time for the first pattern to fire outward so that they can move into the now safe area to avoid the delayed pattern. Simultaneously, the raid must contend withBombogenesis.Bombogenesis- Byakko places AoE markers on four random players, forcing them to split up if they wish to avoid overlapping damage onto unmarked targets.Distant Clap- spawns a lightning-based donut AoE around Byakko's current location, forcing the raid to move towards Byakko to avoid taking damage. Alternatively, if Byakko is positioned at the outer-edge of the arena before castingDistant Clap, players can also move away from the donut to avoid damage, seeing asDistant Clapis not wide enough to cover the entire arena.From this point onward, Byakko will begin to cycle through previous displayed mechanics with various overlaps, including moreHundredfold Havoc(outward travelling lightning AoE's),Fire & Lightning(straight-line AoE's),State Of Shock(body-slam stack-markers),Storm Pulse(unavoidable AoE), andUnrelenting Anguish(outward travelling red orbs), and more, until Byakko has been defeated (or the raid suffers a wipe). Aside from forming slightly more challenging overlaps, all mechanics are handled in the exact same manner as they were before.Loot15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsByakko Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)ImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
