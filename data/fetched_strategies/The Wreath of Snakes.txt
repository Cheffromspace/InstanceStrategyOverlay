They each use 10-Tonze Swing (AoE centered on themselves), followed by Kanabo (tether on one party member which turns into a line AoE). Tethered players should move to edges so the party doesn't need to dodge.Red Wheels + Blue Wheel: Red Wheels each tether to a player, then charge through them in a line. Blue Wheel creates a stack line marker on one player.Ten-no-Shiki(flying creatures): Create wide line aoes across the arena(Phase 1 Only)Numa-no-shikiandDoro-no-shiki: Head creatures that explode when killed. Summoned in 2 waves of 1 large head and 3 small heads each. Try to space apart kills so healers have time to heal between explosions. Must be killed before Seiryu's mana bar fills or the party will wipe.(Phase 2 Only)Blue Orochi(horde of snakes): Summoned twice in a row. Rush across the platform, dealing damage and pushing everyone about halfway across. Second set is usually accompanied by Forbidden Arts.(Phase 2 Only)Yama-No-Shiki(giant water guy): Slams a fist on the platform, dealing heavy damage to that half of the platform.

After two fist slams, he will slam the center, which knocks everyone back.Strength of Spirit-(Phase 1 Only)Knockback + heavy damage and stun. Transitions fight to Phase 2. Damage is based on how much mana meter filled during Numa-no-shiki and Doro-no-shiki add phase.

Phase shift signaled by Strength of Spirit after the Numa-no-shiki and Doro-no-shiki adds are killed.Phase 2: Fight is on an island.
