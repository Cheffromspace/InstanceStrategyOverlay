The great ice wall, Snowcloak, is one such construct molded in the aftermath of Bahamut’s rampage. Once thought to be impassable, recent reports tell of a network of tunnels piercing through the heart of this crystalline impasse. Duty demands these passageways be investigated, but woe unto he who finds their creator.— In-game descriptionSnowcloakis a level 50dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.4.

("Ice has begun forming on gear. A stack of 4 will result in Deep Freeze.") Once this debuff reaches 4 stacks, the player is afflicted withDeep Freezefor a short duration. Periodically he will summonFrost Bombswhich will self-destruct after some time or when they get low health. These should be killed to avoid additional damage and more stacks of the debuff. Healers should keep an eye on their stack count and try to top up the party's health before they're stunned.AbilitiesCold Wave: Summons AoE circles beneath each player. Inflicts a stack ofFrozendebuff.Snow Drift: Deals unavoidable raid-wide damage. Inflicts a stack ofFrozen. Keep moving to negate the debuff.Periodically,Frost Bombadds are summoned throughout the encounter. If not dealt with, they will cast Hypothermal Combustion.Hypothermal Combustion: Arena wide AoE. Inflicts a stack ofFrozen.YetiAbilitiesBuffet: Frontal cone AoE.Northerlies: Summons six untargetable snowballs, each with a point blank AoE. Yeti will breathe on one to two of the snowballs, increasing the size of the snowball and it's resulting AoE.Updrift: Launches players into the air, dealing damage and preventing movement. Cast shortly after Northerlies.Spin: Point blank AoE, immediately followed by a donut AoE.Frozen Spike: Player targeted AoE.FenrirAbilitiesFenrir will alternate between casting party-wide attacks, Heavensward Roar, and Howling Moon/Lunar Cry.Heavensward Roar: a cone attack in front of Fenrir which puts no AoE indicator on the ground but has a long animation time. Move to Fenrir's sides or rear.Ecliptic Bite: very high damage tank busterThousand Year Storm: unavoidable party-wide attackHowling Moon: Four icicles drop to the ground in a diamond pattern, preempted by circular AoE indicators. Immediately followed by Lunar Cry.Lunar Cry: Long-duration cast that will instantly knock out any players not hiding behind an icicle. The first time Lunar Cry is cast, you can hide behind any of the four icicles to block the attack.After the first Lunar Cry, you must hide behind the icicle which stays blue.The other three of the four icicles will start blue, but turn pink in color and then shatter. As soon as Lunar Cry finishes, the icicle will explode in a circular AoE, freezing nearby players for 10 seconds and applying damage over time. Either stand far enough away from the icicle while also remaining out of sight, or stay near the icicle and be prepared to move quickly after the cast finishes.After Lunar Cry, Fenrir will jump onto the tank for moderate damage with no telegraph.BestiaryNameDropsChary HarrierDove AevisIbexIce BombIce SpriteFenrirFrostboundGlacier SpriteHrimthursHybrid GatorNameDropsNorthern BateleurSnowballSnowcloak GoobbueSnowcloak WolfSnowclopsSpriggan IcecutterSpriggan TumblerWandilWhite BearYetiNortherliesLootSee also:Mythology Armor,Mythology AccessoriesandKakalanWandil15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAntique SolleretsOtherN/ABGreen1Hero's Ring of AimingRing90CBlue1Hero's Ring of CastingRing90CBlue1Hero's Ring of FendingRing90CBlue1Hero's Ring of HealingRing90CBlue1Hero's Ring of SlayingRing90CBlue1Yeti20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityHero's Bracelet of FendingBracelets90CBlue1Hero's Bracelet of SlayingBracelets90CBlue1Hero's Bracelet of AimingBracelets90CBlue1Hero's Bracelet of CastingBracelets90CBlue1Hero's Bracelet of HealingBracelets90CBlue1Antique GauntletsOtherN/ABGreen1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityHero's Earrings of FendingEarrings90CBlue1Hero's Earrings of SlayingEarrings90CBlue1Hero's Earrings of AimingEarrings90CBlue1Hero's Earrings of CastingEarrings90CBlue1Hero's Earrings of HealingEarrings90CBlue1Antique HelmOtherN/ABGreen1Fenrir35Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsFenrir Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)The Warrens Orchestrion Roll(Drops at a fixed rate.)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAntique BreechesOtherN/ABGreen1Antique MailOtherN/ABGreen1Hero's Necklace of AimingNecklace90CBlue1Hero's Necklace of CastingNecklace90CBlue1Hero's Necklace of FendingNecklace90CBlue1Hero's Necklace of HealingNecklace90CBlue1Hero's Necklace of SlayingNecklace90CBlue1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Snowcloak10Discover every location withinSnowcloak.-2.4ImagesLoreInto the Heart of IceA dizzying ravine once clove the region of Coerthas, separating the central and western highlands, and straddling this divide was a bridge known as Gargoyle Crossing. When the Calamity wrought a great freeze upon these lands, however, an avalanche engulfed both ravine and bridge in snow, and raised in their place an impenetrable ice wall: Snowcloak.Seeking refuge from the bitter cold, the desperate inhabitants of Falcon’s Nest decided to make the perilous climb over the wall in order to reach Ishgard. But as the last of the group began their ascent, a section of the structure broke loose, entombing them beneath tons of ice. By some miracle, one little girl survived the tragedy, yet bereft of her kin and forced to turn back alone, it may be said that hers was the crueler fate. Her name was Ysayle Dangoulain, and she would one day become known as Iceheart.Years on from that day, now leading the heretics, Iceheart ordered her minions to dig a network of tunnels through Snowcloak. These secret passageways served as a base, allowing them to operate close to Ishgard with their enemies none the wiser.WandilBrought to life by the primal Shiva, this golem guardian’s hulking body is composed of icicles. Holding sway over the element of ice, it can unleash scouring drifts of snow to afflict its foes with frostbite.FenrirA massive hoarhound beholden to Lady Iceheart. With its shimmering hide reminiscent of pale moonlight and a demeanor just as cold, this imposing beast was named after the legendary spirit-hound Fenrir. It fell upon the adventurers who had stormed Snowcloak, but was slain in the attempt to protect its mistress.MoreWithin the tunnels, the heretics had built a makeshift aetheryte connecting Snowcloak to another of their strongholds, the Akh Afah Amphitheatre.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
