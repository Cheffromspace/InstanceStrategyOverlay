After years of protest, the building was finally sold to a wealthyduskwightby the name of Lady Amandine.While little is known of the Lady, it was said that she was exceptionally vain, and that to maintain her impeccable beauty, she would spare no expense. From facial creams concocted from rare Coerthas honeys to shampoos derived from the milk of exotic phurbles, her daily ritual of beauty treatments escalated until it was rumored she was bathing in the blood of her virgin maidservants. No amount of man-made tinctures, however could hide the hideous scars she eventually suffered during the Calamity, and from that day forth she was forced to turn to a darker solution, signing away her very soul in a final effort to "save face."— In-game descriptionHaukke Manoris a level 28dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.

Many rooms are locked and will require the party to collectTiny Keysto progress.Because the extra loot is typically of little value, many parties will skip the side rooms.Optimal pathing for the dungeon is as follows (this skips optional side rooms and requires only collecting the minimum number of keys needed to progress to the end):At the start, head left, into the hall, and left to the first side room.Defeat the enemies and collect theTiny Key.Return to the hallway and follow it until reaching the intersection. Head to the right room.In the right room, defeat the enemies and open the door with the key.Collect theTiny Keyin the next room. Exit to the hallway and ignore the rooms/doors until reaching theIvy Door.Head right to the boss room and defeat theManor Claviger.Collect theGreen Keyand backtrack to theIvy Doorand unlock it.Jump down to the basement (do not need to take the stairs).Ignore the key. Defeat the enemies or pull them into the hallway.Go left at the hallway and circle clockwise, defeating enemies and ignoring all rooms, until reaching the south room (right before the slope of debris).Open the locked door with a key, defeat the enemies in the cell, and collect theYellow Key.Go up the slope, return to theCarnation Door, and unlock it.Defeat theManor StewardandManor Jesterand collect theBloody Parchment.Interact with theAetherial Flowto return to the foyer.Go up the stairs and interact with theSealed Barrier.Proceed toLady Amandine's chamber after fighting theManor Sentry.Visiting all side rooms is required for theMapping the Realm: Haukke Manorachievement. Players who wish to obtain this achievement should useDuty Support, communicate with theirDuty Finderparty that they would like to open all side rooms, or run the dungeon solo withUnrestricted Party(unsyncing) settings when they are of sufficiently high level.BossesManor ClavigerManor Claviger has an untelegraphed melee cleaver attack. The attack can do massive physical damage to lightly armored party members. Make sure the tank faces her away from the rest of the party. When defeated, the doors leading to the Foyer will open, and Claviger will drop a Green Key. Do not go forward to the Foyer. Instead, proceed back out of the entrance of the boss room and use the Green Key to unlock the Ivy Door.Sweet Steelis an untelegraphed cone AoE melee attack.Void Fire IIis an interruptible AoE spell, typically targeted on a player at range from the boss (ranged DPS, healer).Dark Mistis a large PBAoE spell. This spell can be avoided by stunning Claviger.Manor JesterandManor StewardManor Jester and Manor Steward are two bosses located in the same room. Jester is the spell caster and Steward is the tank. Players should kill Jester first because it deals more damage and has lessHP. When defeated, Steward will drop a slip of Bloody Parchment. As ofPatch 6.1, there is a teleporter that will return you to the entrance of the dungeon afterwards. Then, use the Bloody Parchment to unlock the Sealed Barrier along the stairs.Ice Spikes(Jester) is an interruptible spell.Soul Drain(Steward) is a large PBAoE spell. This spell can be avoided by stunning Steward.Lady AmandineLady Amandine, anElezenDuskwightthaumaturge, is the main boss of Haukke Manor.As ofpatch 6.1, the boss mechanics have changed. Lady Amandine will cast Void Fire and Void Thunder. Avoid her spellcast if possible byinterruptingher. Sometimes, Lady Amandine will teleport to one side of the arena and cast aSeducedebuff, causing you to walk slowly towards her while the AoE is being cast, but it is only for a couple seconds, giving you enough time to quickly turn around. Overall, this battle is significantly easier than the original form. She can also summon aManor SentryandLady's Handmaidens.Void Fire IIIis an interruptible spell.Void Thunder IIIis an interruptible spell.Dark Mistis a large PBAoE spell.

This sentiment was eventually acknowledged by the Elder Seedseer before the previous, a known reformist, who ordered the estate sold off, and the title came to be in the possession of a proud and ancient Wildwood family—the Dartancours.The young mistress of the house, Lady Amandine, was famed for her beauty. Alas, the Calamity left her hideously disfigured, and she subsequently sequestered herself from the world. Not long thereafter, a series of gruesome killings shook the Twelveswood. The bodies of maidens began turning up, one after the next, their mutilated faces tying the murders together.The Order of the Twin Adder and the Wood Wailers embarked upon an investigation, but the mystery would be solved by one adventurer, who discovered that the lady, under Ascian manipulation, had entered into a pact with beings of darkness. In a twisted bid to regain her beauty, she made blood sacrifices of her maidservants, and in so doing transformed the manor into a lair of voidsent.The Manor StewardDespite loyal service to his lady, the manor steward was sacrificed like so many others. Those brave enough to set foot in the manor spoke of spine-chilling scenes of voidsent overrunning the halls, occupying the flesh of servants. From maids to jester, none were spared.Purge Of The ManorScarred by the Calamity and warped by vanity, Lady Amandine made a bargain with a voidsent—and paid dearly, losing her soul and becoming one of the dark creatures haunting her manor home. Alerted to these sinister happenings, the Wood Wailers dispatched a squad of their best to purge Hauke Manor of voidsent. None were seen nor heard from again.A second squad was assembled, this time comprising adventurers with extensive experience against the unholy beings. These dauntless individuals succeeded in eliminating all of the voidsent, including their leader, Halicarnassus, thereby ridding the Twelveswood of a dangerous menace.HalicarnassusA high-ranking voidsent who holds position of authority among succubi. It bears mentioning that the name Halicarnassus was not her own, but rather one taken from an ancient fable and given by Lady Amandine, a noted bibliophile. This attests to the voidsent's aversion to being under another's power, as they do not readily reveal their true names—not even to those with whom they forge a pact.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
