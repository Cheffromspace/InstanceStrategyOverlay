ImportantThe North American and European data centers primarily useParty Finderto challenge (Extreme) content. Using Duty Finder to match with random players is not recommended and will be more difficult than pre-forming a party. For an easy completion (that will satisfy any quest requirements) or loot farming, it is recommended that players use Party Finder and form anUnrestricted Party(i.e., with level sync disabled). Players who wish to complete this duty with level sync enabled should also form a pre-made party, which also enables the use ofMinimum Item LevelandSilence Echosettings for a more authentic challenge compared to a Duty Finder party.This article is about the level 70 challenge-modetrial.

Players will start with 3 charges of Vril that must be spread out over the course of the fight. Using Vril has a similar effect toEmanation, preventing negating certain mechanics including Lakshmi's ultimate. Refill times can be found in the strategy and rotation sections. Because refill times are so few and far between, players should use Vril as few times as possible.Tail SlapAdd AbilityTanks should face adds away from the party while maintaining top aggro to prevent a party-wide cleave.Inner DemonsAdd AbilityEasy to dodge telegraphed gaze attack. If missed, will cause stun to players caught by the gaze.StotramHeal & Raid-wide DamageLakshmi will periodically heal adds by castingStotram. This ability also causes high raid-wide damage.Hand of GraceTelegraphed AoEWorks exactly the same as normal mode except three players will be targeted. Marked players are assigned a+line AoE. Spread out from the party and align yourselves so that there is no overlap to prevent excess damage.The Pull of LightTank BusterHeavy tank buster. Mitigate with cooldowns and heals.The Path of LightFrontal CleaveTargets the second highest enmity target (marked as a "2" on the party list) with a blue marker. After a few seconds, Lakshmi unleashes a massive frontal cone attack in that player's direction. Bait the attack away from the group, but ensure that it also doesn't hit the main tank as well.Alluring ArmTelegraphed AoELakshmi marks one player with a+line AoE and two other players will be marked with the lily pads. Those marked with the lily pads should spread to avoid overlapping splash damage, and the player marked with the+line AoE should align themselves appropriately to give the rest of the party a large safe zone. An easy way to deal with this is have the+line AoE align themselves directly in the middle of the arena behind Lakshmi and the two players marked with the lily pads move to one of the two large open corners. The unmarked players can then align themselves accordingly.The Pall of LightStack DamageStack on the marked player to share damage.Chanchala / Chimichanga / ChinchillaBuffImmediately use Vril as soon as Lakshmi starts her casting animation. Chanchala increases the damage of Lakshmi's attacks and adds new abilities to them. In addition, Chanchala also enables Lakshmi to use her Divine attacks.Divine Denial (Chanchala)Raid-wide KnockbackArena-wide knockback AoE that will kill anyone who hasn't used Vril. This skill still causes knockback even with Vril, so be sure to stand close to the center to avoid being knocked off the platform.Hand of Beauty (Chanchala)Telegraphed AoEBoth healers will be marked with puddles. Healers should split to opposite sides of the arena. Healers should use Vrilbeforethe puddle drops to avoid status debuffs. The puddles dropped in this form will spawn, grow in size twice, then disappear.The Pull of Light (Chanchala)Tank BusterThe same skill as above, except in this form Lakshmi does a significantly larger amount of damage. Tanks can pop a Vril to survive the tank buster.The Path of Light (Chanchala)Frontal CleaveThe player with the second most aggro will be targeted with a heavy hitting frontal cone AoE. In Chanchala form, it will do substantially more damage and a Vril can be popped in order to survive this mechanic.Divine Desire (Chanchala)Raid-wide Pull & BleedLakshmi moves to the middle of the arena and casts an arena-wide pull on all players. Players should pop Vril and stay away from the center to avoid the bleed AoE cast around Lakshmi.Water IIIAdd AbilityMarks players with an orange marker. Marked players need to move away from the group to avoid splash damage.Alluring EmbraceUltimatePlayers must pop Vril to survive Lakshmi's ultimate. The ultimate will trigger once the "alluring embrace" gauge reaches 0 regardless if adds in the arena are still alive.Divine DoubtRaid-wide ConfusePlayers will be debuffed with Confusion for 16 seconds causing players to attack each other. Using Vril before this ability will shorten the amount of time Confusion lasts. To avoid ganks, players should split off into groups of two to prevent 2-on-1 situations.Vril RestorationTelegraphed AoEVril bubbles will be spawned around the arena in two separate patterns. These will occur in two sets. The first set includes the following two patterns. The first pattern will be in a "Z" shape, while the second will be in a straight line.The second set includes the next two patterns. The first pattern will be in a circle around the outer edge of the arena. The second pattern will be a "Z" shape again. During these two sets, AoEs will also spawn around the arena. Players should avoid AoEs where possible and replenish their Vril.The Pall of Light (Chanchala)Stack DamageSimilar to the original form, except it hits much harder and applies a heavy bleed debuff to anyone not under the effect of Vril.Stotram(Chanchala)Raid-wide DamageVery heavy hitting skill.Stotramin Chanchala form will instantly kill anyone with the bleed debuff or anyone not topped off. Players should pop a Vril to survive.LootSee also:Lakshmi's AccessoriesEach player will receive 1Bliss Totemper kill.
