The party will also receive a checkpoint that they will restart from if they wipe. In this form, Innocence's attacks hit harder.Righteous Bolt:TankbusterWinged Reprobation:Innocence embeds two swords into the arena which launch three sets of three Line AoEs in symmetrical patterns.Rightful Reprobation:Innocence moves to the center of the arena and sends out eight swords as Line AoEs. After the attack, the swords will linger for a few seconds before returning to Innocence as Line AoEs.

Once the Forgiven Shames have been dealt with, Forgiven Venery will drop its shield and become targetable.Manacle:Ground-targeted Circle AoEs cast by Forgiven Shame.If the Immaculate Authority meter reaches 100,Flaming Swordwill wipe the party. If Forgiven Venery was allowed to sacrifice too many Shames, the stacks ofSlashing Resistance Downwill cause Flaming Sword to deal potentially lethal damage to the party even if the meter was stopped early. The party should heavily mitigate this attack at 2 stacks of the debuff. If there are 3 or more stacks, a TankLimit Breakis recommended.God Ray:Innocence moves to the center of the arena and casts three Cone attacks that hit in three parts (melee range, then mid-range, then long range). Cast three times in a row, with each subsequent cast hitting where a safe area was in the last.Light Pillar:Line-up Stack on a random player.Beatific Vision:Proximity-based Line. Innocence moves to the edge of the arena and charges through to the other side.
