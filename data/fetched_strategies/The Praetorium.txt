Of the many projects to his name, none was more groundbreaking than the revival of the Ultima Weapon. Created to suppress eikons, it was the Black Wolf's key to his conquest of Eorzea—and the Alliance's primary target in Operation Archon.The Ultima WeaponA counter-primal weapon of unparalleled might, the Ultima Weapon is a relic of ancient Allag discovered deep beneath Gyr Abania in a nigh-forgotten, ruin-sized site. Through the ingenuity of Nero tol Scaeva, it was restored to working order and made battle-ready, but dark rumors surround its source of power, the Heart of Sabik, which some claim was gifted from the Ascians.Gaius van BaelsarA general and governor both, his many accomplishments include the conquest and political assimilation of five enemy cities. Fearsome in battle, he personally rose to challenge those adventurers who stormed Castrum Meridianum, wielding his gunblade Heirsbane with deadly effect.MoreThe ancient magick sealed within the Ultima Weapon wreaked untold havoc, tearing open a crater of charred steel.
