ThatIceheartand her followers intend to summon Shiva with the crystals they have stolen is plain. But is this unprecedented act even possible? If so, then Ishgard─if not the entire realm─is in grave danger.— In-game descriptionThe Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)is a level 50trialintroduced inpatch 2.4.Contents1Guide1.1Lady of Frost: Shiva2Loot3ImagesGuideLady of Frost:ShivaIt's worth noting that on Hard (instead of Extreme) mode herIcebrandduringSword & Shieldcannotbe soaked by the party and Shiva should simply be tank & spanked away from the party at all times. Also, theDamage Upbuff will cap at 16 stacks, serving as a soft enrage, although this is almost never an issue.In her unarmed form, Shiva's auto attacks will hit in a small cleave so she should be faced away from the party.Phase 1Dreams of Ice: Shiva occasionally uses this action, gaining a permanent, stackableDamage Upbuff.Shiva will periodically switch between one of three stances (sword, staff, or unarmed) determining her attacks.Staff form:Shiva'sFrost Brandbuff will slightly increase the damage she deals.Hailstorm: Telegraphed circle AoEs on random players. Spread out to avoid overlap.Absolute Zero(no cast bar): Untelegraphed party-wide damage.Shiva will return to herunarmed form:Icicle Impact(no cast bar): Initially spawns five circle AoE telegraphs. Move to one of four safe spots that are 90 degrees from each other. Being hit will inflict a stack ofVulnerability Up.Sword form:Also note that failing any mechanic will debuff with a stackingVulnerability UpShiva'sFrost Brandbuff will reduce the damage she takes and give her slight healing-over-time.Icebrand(no cast bar): An untelegraphed conal tankbuster immediately used after switching to this form. The main tank should use mitigation and ensure to face this away from the party.Heavenly Strike(no cast bar): Untelegraphed minor knockback from the boss's current position. Can be prevented withSurecastorArm's Length.Glacier Bash: Frontal cone that will inflict heavy damage andStunanyone hit. Move behind.Phase 2Shiva will go to the center of the arena and spawn fourIce Soldieradds. These should be picked up by the tanks, grouped together, and killed by the rest of the party.Shiva will still transition into staff or sword form and repeat the previous attacks. The party should be especially mindful not to be cleaved withIcebrand.After the adds are killed or if enough time passes, Shiva will inflictDeep Freezeon everyone and useDiamond Dust, dealing party-wide damage. If any adds are still alive before Shiva disappears, the party will be wiped instead.Phase 3From here on, touching the edge of the arena will freeze the player into a boulder. Frozen player can be freed after party members kill the boulder.Shiva will continue transitioning between unarmed, staff, and sword forms and has all of her previous attacks. In addition, she will use two new attacks:Icicle Impact(version 2, no cast bar): Nine circle AoEs will sequentially appear covering the middle and the outside of the arena. Start in the last AoE telegraph and dodge into the first one after it resolves. Being hit will inflict a stack ofVulnerability Up.Permafrost: Shiva temporarily freezes the floor, giving everyoneThin Ice, causing to slide a long distance if they move.
