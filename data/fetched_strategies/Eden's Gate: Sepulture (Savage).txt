The raid is also known asE4S. Completing this duty, which can be done with anUnrestricted Party(unsynced), is needed to unlockThe Epic of Alexander (Ultimate).Contents1Phases & Abilities1.1Heritor of Crags: Titan1.2Titan Fists Phase1.3Titan Wheels Phase1.4Titan Maximum1.5Orogenesis2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 23Achievements4ImagesPhases & AbilitiesHeritor of Crags:TitanNOTE:It is possible to fall off the edge of the arena and plummet to an early doom during the entire encounter. However, should any participant fall, they can be raised after a moderate delay. The arena is also segmented into 16 tiles that play a significant role in Titan's mechanics.Stonecrusher- Titan's tankbuster - will stomp on the primary target three times in a row, inflicting tremendous damage and a stackable debuff with each hit. Just like normal mode, it also inflicts damage in a non-telegraphed AoE radius, meaning it will annihilate any non-tanks that are too close to the point of impact. Due to the damage and debuffs inflicted per stomp, tanks should decide between a double tank-swap in-between each hit, or to assign a tank with animmunity cooldownto take all three hits at once.Weight of the Landwill mark random tiles throughout the arena and detonate them for massive AoE damage after a brief delay. All players must make an effort to move to an unaffected tile as soon as possible.Weight of the Landwill slightly overlapPulse of the Land.Pulse of the Landmarks each individual player with a triangle-shaped (yellow) icon. Once the mark expires, the tile that a marked player is standing on will explode for moderate damage and inflict a stackableMagic Vulnerabilitydebuff. To combat the effects, each individual player should stand within an unoccupied tile so that each marked player only takes damage from their own mark. If more than one marked player occupies the same tile during the explosion, the stacking debuff will result in fatal damage. Bear in mind thatPulse of the Landwill frequently overlap with other tile-based mechanics, thus it is wise to assign each individual player to their own tile before the encounter.Evil Earthwill marktwotiles in the arena that will eventually explode, then cause all adjacent tiles to explode shortly afterward, repeatedly chaining in an outward wave of explosions. There are four potential patterns to be mindful of, and unlike normal mode, the expanding wave of explosions willnotbe telegraphed. For a visual reference ofEvil Earthpatterns, players may consider checkingMTQcapture's E4S video.Force of the Landmarks all players with a square-shaped (orange) icon. Players marked byForce of the Landmust ensure that they are standing on the same tile with other players who have the same mark so that they can share the upcoming damage. Due to overlapping with mechanics such asEvil Earth, it is often best to group up to evade it so that the team are stacked together whenForce of the Landdetonates, allowing the entire group the share the damage evenly, though this isn't mandatory.Voice of the Landinflicts unavoidable damage to the entire raid that must be healed through.Geocrushcauses Titan to leap towards a random segment of the arena and blast the raid with massive knockback (far greater than the normal version). Before leaping, a visual effect of outward travelling arrows from the point of impact will give you an idea of where Titan will land and in what direction you will be punted to. Due to the tremendous knockback, players must ensure that they are close to the point of impact and aim themselves so that they get knocked back into the farthest corner of the arena. If standing too far away, or aimed incorrectly, players will be launched over the side to their doom. However, bear in mind thatknockback immunitywill prevent this knockback entirely.NOTE:As soon asGeocrushhas ended, Titan will execute one of two mechanics -Titan FistsorTitan Wheels. At the same time, multiple players will be marked byForce of the Land(5 x orange markers) andPulse of the Land(3 x yellow) markers. Bear in mind thatPulse of the Land(yellow) will always target one random tank, healer, and DPS at this point.Titan Fists PhaseTitan Fists- causes Titan to morph his body so that his fists are much larger than normal, allowing him to unleash mechanics unique to this form. After a brief delay, Titan will smash all tiles to his sides. Anyone not standing on tiles in front of Titan will immediately be slain or knocked off the platform.Due to overlapping with orange and yellow markers, all orange-marked players should stack on the tile directly beneath Titan to mass-absorb the upcoming damage fromForce of the Land, whereas players with yellow markers should stand on their own individual tiles along the line in front of him so thatPulse of the Landwill only affect those individual players. Bear in mind that as soon as theside-slamhas been executed, the tiles directly in front of Titan will also explode after a brief delay, forcing all players to move to a side to avoid the secondary explosion.Voice of the Landinflicts unavoidable damage to the entire raid that must be healed through.Landslidecauses Titan to leap towards a cardinal point of the arena. On impact, non-telegraphed blasts (two tiles wide) will be unleashed across the entire arena in horizontal and vertical lines from the impact point. As a result, only the corners of the arena farthest away from Titan's point of impact will be safe from the blast. Once the initial impact mechanic has concluded, the tiles that were originally safe will soon explode, forcing the raid to move back towards Titan as soon as possible.Bomb Boulderswill spawn around the arena shortly after the initial impact - forming either a "+" or "x" pattern. Keep in mind that boulders will explode in the order that they spawned. In addition, they won't begin to detonate until the below mechanic (Landslide).Landslide (Left or Right)causes Titan to target half of the arena to his left or right. After a brief delay, that side of the arena will explode. As soon asLandslidehas concluded, the previouslysafeside of the arena will also explode after a brief delay, forcing the raid to swap side.Assuming the raid survives, Titan will morph back to his original form and the fight resumes.Titan Wheels PhaseTitan Wheels- causes Titan to morph so that the circular parts of his body form four wheels, similar to that of a go-kart. After a brief wind-up, Titan will launch himself forward, crushing anyone directly in front of him with fatal damage and knocking back everyone else. Just like normal mode, players must avoid being in front of Titan and position themselves on tiles directly beside the line he willdrivethrough. Due to the tremendous knockback, make sure you are standing on the side with the most arena-space so that you are not knocked off the platform.Due to overlapping with orange and yellow markers, all orange-marked players should stack directly beside Titan to mass-absorb the upcoming damage fromForce of the Landafter the knockback, whereas players with yellow markers should stand on their own individual tiles along thedrive-lineso thatPulse of the Landwill only affect those individual players.Fault Linewill be executed some time after the knockback, causing Titan to drive towards the main target and inflict large AoE impact damage. Bear in mind that other mechanics will also be executed from whatever position Titan ends up at. As a result, it is good practice to have a tank (farthest away from Titan) provoke him if necessary and run to a tile directly opposite from him, preventing the raid from being crushed and positioning him close to where he originally morphed.Magnitude, an arena-wide donut AoE from Titan's current position, will always followFault Line. After dealing with the orange and yellow markers, all players need to be standing within Titan's hitbox to avoid being slaughtered. Unfortunately,Magnitudewill be immediately followed by anotherPulse of the Land(yellow markers) on all members of the raid, forcing them to leave Titan's hitbox as soon as possible and move to individual tiles before they explode.Assuming the raid survives, Titan will morph back to his original form and the fight resumes.OnceTitan FistsorTitan Wheelshas ended, the fight resumes.Crumbling Downmarks oneDPSplus either atankorhealerwith special markers. After a brief delay, these players will drop proximity markers at their current location. After the proximity markers have been dropped, two more players will also be marked for another two proximity drops. All proximity markers leads to giant boulders falling down into the arena at the marked locations that will be used to line-of-sight Titan duringSeismic Wave(similar to normal mode). Those who do not line-of-sight Titan duringSeismic Wavewill be pummeled with tremendous damage. Bear in mind that any large boulders dropped too close to Titan will crumble immediately, so be sure to place them near the corners of the arena while tanking Titan as close to the center as possible.Simultaneously, the raid will also have to contend with another set ofBomb Bouldersthat will eventually explode in the order they were dropped in, so be careful.Voice of the Landinflicts unavoidable damage to the entire raid that must be healed through.Stonecrusher- Titan's tankbuster - follow afterwards. Remember to either double-tank-swap or use animmunity cooldown.Geocrushcauses Titan to leap towards a random segment of the arena and blast the raid with massive knockback, just like before. Once it concludes, Titan will either useTitan FistsorTitan Wheels(whichever he did not morph into after the previousGeocrush.After the the second morph has concluded (Titan FistsorTitan Wheels), Titan will become untargetable and traverse to the north of the arena before morphing intoTitan Maximum.Titan MaximumTitan MaximumAfter a brief transition, Titan will now be enormous in size and permanently fixed to the north side of the arena with a massive hitbox (two tiles deep).Earthen Furyopens this new phase - blasting the entire raid with tremendous AoE damage.Earthen Fistscauses Titan to slam his fists together and begin charging them up twice in succession. If you notice an arm lighting up and becoming shrouded with a charge-up animation, then that fist is being charged. After two charges, Titan will unleash devastating punches towards the arena - the sides being determined by the order they were charged. For example, if Titan charges his left fist twice, he will punch the left side of the arena twice. However, he may charge either fist and in any order, so pay attention to the animations in order to determine where Titan will punch, as the punches themselves have no telegraph other than a very brief wind-up animation.Weight of the Landwill be executed at the same time as Titan's first punch, marking random squares of the arena for detonation. Players must dodge Titan's punches whilst being mindful of the exploding tiles.Dual Earthen Fistscreates an impact marker directly in front of Titan. After a brief delay, Titan will slam down on the marker, knocking back all players a set distance. To avoid being knocked off the platform, players must stand as close to the circular marker as possible and aim themselves so that they are punted towards one of the two corners. Standing directly in front or beside the marker will result in being swatted off the platform. Bear in mind thatDual Earthen Fistsoverlaps another mechanic -Weight of the World.Weight of the Worldmarks one player with a triangle-shaped (blue) marker. After detonation, it will explode the tile that the marked player is standing on, along with the first set of tiles adjacent to it. Anyone caught in the blast will be hit with moderate damage and aMagic Vulnerability Updebuff. Due to being executed at the same time asDual Earthen Fists(knockback), it is up to the marked player to aim themselves so that they are pushed into the farthest corner tile. Bear in mind thatKnockback Immunitycan also be used to work around the mechanical combo.Earthen Anguishsimultaneously marks both tanks for massive AoE tankbusters. As a result, both tanks must ensure that they are far away from eachother (and the rest of the raid) as possible, preferably at the northern corners of the arena close to Titan himself. Due to being executed directly afterDual Earthen Fists(knockback), tanks may consider pre-positioning and using theirKnockback Immunitycooldowns beforeDual Earthen Fistsin order to remain in the northern side of the arena forEarthen Anguish.Megalithmarks one of the two tanks with a stack marker that will eventually result in tremendous damage. Unlike most stack markers, this should be shared solely by the two tanks (rather than the raid), preferably with mitigation cooldowns.Tectonic Upliftmarks two diagonal quadrants of the arena (4 tiles each) and eventually elevates them (along with any players standing on the quadrant at the time). Those who find themselves on elevated platforms can jump down to a lower platform if required, though it is impossible to traverse from one raised platform to the other, or from one lowered platform to another.Weight of the Worldwill mark oneDPSand either atankorhealerwith the triangle-shaped (blue) marker from before. Once again, marked players will eventually detonate the tile they are standing on along with the first set of tiles adjacent to them, resulting in moderate damage andMagic Vulnerability Updebuffs. As a result, players marked byWeight of the Worldshould make sure that they remain in the corner-most tile of thelower platformduringTectonic Uplift, as the blast will hit the entire quadrant. By staying nearer the center, players on the raised platforms may also be hit by the blast.Due to the presence of an enraged timer, anyone not marked byWeight of the Worldshould split into two groups. The DPS (preferably melee) should optimally take the raised quadrant closer to Titan, whilst everyone else (such as tanks, healers, or ranged DPS) take the raised quadrant farthest from Titan.DuringTectonic Uplift, players standing on soon-to-be-raised platforms will be launched into the air. Simultaneously, those on lower platforms will have to contend with a constant barrage ofWeight of the Land: causing random tiles in the lower quadrants to light up and eventually explode. One quadrant will constantly have one exploding tile, whereas the other will always have two exploding tiles.After the platforms have been raised, a combination ofPulse of the Land(yellow markers),Force of the Land(orange markers) andWeight of the World(blue markers) will be placed on all raid members that are standing on the raised platforms, all of which work the same way as they have before. As a quick refresher, "Blue" markers will cause the tile that the player is standing on to explode (along with the first set of tiles adjacent to it), inflicting damage and magic vulnerability. "Yellow" markers will cause the tile that a player is standing on to detonate for similar damage and debuffs (but without effecting adjacent tiles), whilst the "Orange" tiles require the player to stack with at least one other marked player in order to absorb damage.To deal with this, players marked withWeight of the World(blue) should remain on the raised platforms and move to the farthest corner-tile. Players marked withPulse of the Land(yellow) need to drop down into the lower quadrant that only has one exploding tile fromWeight of the Land, giving three spare tiles to use - one for the unmarked person who started in the lower quadrant and two spare tiles for each yellow-marked player. Players withForce of the Land(orange) markers should drop into the lower quadrant that has two exploding tiles fromWeight of the Landand stack together on one of the safe tiles, leaving the last remaining safe tile for the unmarked player in that quadrant.Earthen Furyblasts the entire raid with tremendous AoE damage. OnceEarthen Furyhas concluded, the arena will turn back to its normal shape.Rock Throwmarks each healer and eventually locks them into an earthen gaol after a brief delay. Bear in mind that Titan will receive a vicious buff if the gaols are placed too close to each other (and will also become much harder to destroy), hence each healer must move as far away from each other as possible. Watch out -Rock Throwwill overlap withPlate Fracture.Plate Fracturecauses Titan to wind himself backward and punch one of the four arena quadrants. Players will need to determine which quadrant is being destroyed by paying attention to Titan's wind-up animation as there will be no other telegraph. Just likeEarthen Fists- you'll be able to see which side Titan is focusing on (left or right) depending on which side he is winding up, as well as the distance (to determine if he will smash the southern or northern tile on that side). After destroying the arena into an "L" shape with the initial punch, Titan will wind up once again for two more consecutivePlate Fractures. If, for example, Titan destroys a northern quadrant with his first punch, the second punch will destroy the one remaining north quadrant, then the third will destroy one of the two remaining southern quadrants (which players must judge by the final punch animation). Similarly, if Titan destroys a southern quadrant, he will then destroy the other southern quadrant, followed by one of the two northern quadrants.Due to overlapping withRock Throw, the two marked Healers must place their gaols as far away from each other as possible whilst paying attention to thePlate Fractureorder. For example, if Titan is about to destroy the south-left quadrant with his first punch, then one healer should place their gaol on the south-right quadrant while the other stands on the north-right quadrant. The healer gaoled on the south-right quadrant would then need to be freed as soon as possible seeing as the other south-quadrant will soon be destroyed by the second punch. If successful, the raid should have time to free the other gaoled healer before Titan has time to select and destroy one of the two remaining tiles. Once again, keep in mind that the order orPlate Fractureheavily depends on which quadrant Titan decides to destroy first, giving you a limited amount of time to place gaols appropriately.Earthen Furywill blast the raid once more with tremendous AoE damage and also restore the arena back to its original form.Tumultwill cause Titan to repeatedly smash the platform with his fist multiple times in a row, inflicting unavoidable raid damage with each slam (five punches in a row).As soon asTumulthas concluded, the raid must deal with anotherDual Earthen Fists+Weight of the World+Megalithcombo just like before. The raid must aim themselves so that they aren't punted off the platform by the upcoming knockback while theWeight of the World(blue) marked player must ensure they are knocked into the farthest corner away from the raid, followed by each tank being marked for the AoE tankbusters - all handled the same way as it was before.Earthen Fistscauses Titan to once again charge up his fists in a random order and proceed to punch across the entire arena based on that order, such as left+left, right+right, left+right, or right+left. Simultaneously, one tile in the arena will be marked viaEvil Earth- eventually exploding, then marking all adjacent tiles for explosions, continuing in an outward wave, forcing all players to weave between Titan's punches and exploding tiles. Due to the randomness ofEarthen Fistsand the initialEvil Earthtile, all players must be on their toes throughout.Tectonic Upliftonce again marks two diagonal quadrants of the arena (4 tiles each) and prepares to elevate them (along with any players standing on the quadrant at the time). Unlike the firstTectonic Uplift, four players will also be marked withForce of the Land(orange markers). A good rule of thumb is to have all four marked players stack on one rising quadrant, whilst the four unmarked players move to the other rising quadrant, ensuring that the entire raid starts on elevated platforms. Make sure to remain stacked untilForce of the Landhas been absorbed.To deal with upcoming mechanics, it is wise to assign each player their very own tile in their respective raised quadrant.Rock Throwmarks each healer and eventually locks them into an earthen gaol after a brief delay. It is likely that there will be one healer per risen quadrant due to the previousForce of the Landmarks, so ensure that each healer remains in their individual tile. Three players per quadrant will now be tasked with breaking their healer out of their earthen gaol over the course of the next few mechanics, starting with:Pulse of the Land(yellow markers). Assuming the raid has divided into four-per-quadrant and has been assigned their own tile, players must simply remain on their tile. Bear in mind that gaoled healers will also have their own yellow marker.Weight of the World(blue markers) will be placed on two players (either both healers or both tanks). Have each marked player run to different lower-quadrants (the corner-most tile) so that nobody is clipped by the resulting explosions. Simultaneously, Titan will begin to pepper the lower quadrants with randomWeight of the Landexplosions. One quadrant will constantly have three exploding tiles (only one safe tile), while the other quadrant will always have two exploding tiles (leaving two safe tiles).Weight of the World(blue markers) will now be placed on two players on the raised platforms - either both tanks or both healers (depending on which role was marked first). This time, blue-marked players should remain on the raised platforms, moving to their corner-most tile to avoid exploding lower quadrants.Force of the Land(orange markers) will effect all four DPS at the same time, forcing them to stack up to absorb the upcoming blast. As a rule of thumb, orange-marked players should drop down into the quadrant which has two safe tiles fromWeight of the Land.Earthen Furywill blast the raid once again with vicious AoE damage and restore the arena back to its original form, followed by another fiveTumultsmashes (AoE damage) for yet more AoE.Plate Fracturewill be unleashed once again, causing Titan to wind himself backward and punch one of the four arena quadrants into oblivion - immediately followed byMegalith- requiring both tanks to stack together and absorb a tremendous tankbuster. Despite being indicated by a regular stack marker, only tanks should stack together. OnceMegalithhas concluded, Titan will prepare anotherPlate Fracture, forcing the raid to once again check Titan's animation and move away from the quadrant about to be destroyed.Simultaneously, one player will be marked withWeight of the World(blue), three withPulse of the Land(yellow), and four withForce of the Land(orange). Seeing as the arena is soon to lose yet another quadrant, players must position themselves on the two remaining quadrants so that (blue) has a quadrant to itself (moving to the farthest corner possible), while each (yellow) individually uses one of three tiles on the other quadrant, and all (orange) stack on the same quadrant in the one remaining tile to safely absorb damage.Earthen Furywill blast the raid again and restore the arena back to its original form.OrogenesisIf you have survived the ordeal thus far, participants will witness Titan Maximum become untargetable and vomit out another Titan in his regular (smaller) form, indicating the final phase. From here on, participants are forced to contend with mechanics from both Titan's simultaneously.Duo Earthen Furywill blast the raid with vicious AoE just like before, except now, the entire raid will suffer a 12 second DoT.Weight of the Landwill mark random tiles throughout the arena and detonate them for massive AoE damage after a brief delay. Unlike all previous instances ofWeight of the Land, this version will essentially rotate its pattern for a considerable time. As a result, players will need to pay close attention to the tile pattern and the explosions in order to predict (and avoid) future explosions, as only the initial explosions have a telegraph. Simultaneously, all tanks and healers will be (orange) marked byForce of the Landwhilst all DPS are given a (yellow)Pulse of the Landmarker. Whilst dealing with the rotatingWeight of the Landexplosions, (orange) players must stick together on a safe tile to absorb upcoming damage, whilst each (yellow) player must find their own individual safe tile. Should the raid survive,Weight of the Landwill cease before the next mechanic.As soon as the above combo has concluded, the raid must deal with a third and finalDual Earthen Fists+Weight of the World+Megalithcombo just like before. Just like earlier, the raid should aim themselves so that they aren't punted off the platform by the upcoming knockback while theWeight of the World(blue) marked player must ensure they are knocked into the farthest corner away from the raid, followed by each tank being marked for the AoE tankbusters - all handled the same way as it was before.Voice of the Land(AoE damage) will blast the raid, followed by another fiveTumultslams (even more AoE), thenVoice of the Land(AoE), topped off by anotherDuo Earthen Fury(AoE + 12 second DoT).Weight of the Landwill again mark random tiles throughout the arena and detonate them for massive (rotating) AoE damage after a brief delay. This time, all DPS will be be marked byForce of the Land(orange) whilst all healers and tanks will acquire a (yellow)Pulse of the Landmarker. Despite the inverse marks, the process is the same - (orange) players must stick together on a safe tile to absorb upcoming damage, whilst (yellow) players must find their own individual safe tile. Should the raid survive,Weight of the Landwill cease before the next mechanic.Earthen Fistscauses Titan Maximum to begin charging up his fists in a random order and eventually punch across the entire arena based on that order, followed by regular Titan usingStonecrusher, the (AoE) triple-stomp tankbuster, forcing either a double-tank-swap or an immunity cooldown if you wish to take all three hits.Megalithfollows, marking both tanks with a stack marker and forcing them to absorb a tremendous duo-tankbuster. Despite being indicated by a normal stack markers, only the tanks should absorb the damage. OnceMegalithconcludes, the raid will be bombarded with yet anotherEarthen Furythat must be healed through.Weight of the Landwill yet again mark random tiles throughout the arena and rotate explosions around the arena, whilst marking players withPulse of the LandandForce of the Landin the same pattern as the first combination (tanks & healers with orange, DPS with yellow), all dealt with in the same manner as before.Earthen Fistsfollows, causing Titan Maximum to begin charging up his fists in a random order and punch across the entire arena twice in a row yet again.AnotherVoice of the Land(AoE), followed by another fiveTumultslams (AoE),Voice of the Land(AoE), along with another fiveTumultslams (AoE), and a finalVoice of the Land(AoE).Should you (or Titan) remain alive after the tremendous AoE bombardment, Titan will begin hard-charging a megaEarthen Furythat will wipe the entire raid unless he is defeated beforehand.LootSee also:Edengrace Weapons1Book of Sepulture(guaranteed)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPaladin's Edengrace Arms (IL 475)OtherN/ACBlue1Edengrace BattleaxeMarauder's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace GreatswordDark Knight's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace ManatriggerGunbreaker's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace SpearLancer's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace KnucklesPugilist's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace BladeSamurai's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace KnivesRogue's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace Harp BowArcher's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace RevolverMachinist's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace TathlumsDancer's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace RodTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm475CBlue1Book of GraceArcanist's Grimoire475CBlue1Edengrace RapierRed Mage's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm475CBlue1Word of GraceScholar's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace PlanisphereAstrologian's Arm475CBlue1Edengrace Chest Gear Coffer (IL 470)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityEdengrace Weapon Coffer (IL 475)OtherN/AABasic1Eden MinorMinionN/AABasic1Skyslipper KeyOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchSavage Paradise Found I5CompleteEden's Gate (Savage).-5.05Savage Paradise Found II10CompleteEden's Gate (Savage)5 times.-5.05Savage Paradise Found III20CompleteEden's Gate (Savage)10 times.-5.05Mightier than the Gate5Complete Eden's Gate: Sepulture (Savage) with a party of only blue mages, Silence Echo turned on, and Unrestricted Party turned off.-6.45ImagesRaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
