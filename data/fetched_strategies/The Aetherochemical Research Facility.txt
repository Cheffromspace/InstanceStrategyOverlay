However, he and his knights are not the only threat for which you must be prepared; shortly before your arrival, the VIth Imperial Legion entered the facility in search of the secret to mastering primals, and their presence will serve to complicate matters. With multiple factions and their ambitions set on a collision course, your mission promises to be fraught with danger and uncertainty both.— In-game descriptionThe Aetherochemical Research Facilityis a level 60dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.0withHeavensward.

Otherwise, the target player will take high damage.Gaseous Bombis a stack marker targeting a random player. The entire party should stack.Lahabrea&IgeyorhmAs ofPatch 6.3, the battle will only end when bothAscians' health are reduced to 0.1% instead of 50%, and both will always be targettable.Shadow Flare: Unavoidable Raidwade damage cast by LahabreaFire Sphere: Lahabrea summons five untargettableBurning Starsthat will explode in AoE circles after a few seconds.Esoteric Fusion: Another version of this spell will result in two pairs of Burning Stars that are tethered and advance towards each other, which will explode upon contact.Grip of Night: A frontal cone AoE cast by Igeyorhm.Circle of Ice: Igeyorhm summons fourFrozen Starsthat detonate Donut AoE circles. Stand on theFrozen Starsto avoid damage.Esoteric Fusion: Igeyorhm will tether two of herFrozen Starstogether, creating a bigger donut AoE that covers the safe spots in the otherFrozen Stars. Players should therefore stand under where the tetheredFrozen Starswill detonate to avoid damage.End of Days: Similar to theTowering Oliphant'sRoutattack inThe Dusk Vigil, this is a line stack marker, which requires players to line up between Lahabrea and the targetted player.Dark Fire II: Lahabrea puts circle purple AoE markers on all players, who should spread to avoid overlapping.If the health difference between the bosses become too large, the higher HP boss will transfer some of its health to the lower HP boss.Ascian PrimeThe dungeon does not end whenLahabreaandIgeyorhmare defeated. Instead, a notably long but skippable cutscene will show the two merging into the real final boss, Ascian Prime. In addition, failing mechanics will now inflictVulnerability Upon players.Shadow Flare: Unavoidable Raidwide Damage.Height of Chaos: TankbusterDualstar: Features combinations of the tetheredBurning StarsandFrozen Starsfrom the previous battle. Ascian Prime will then castFusion Primeto make them collide.  If non-tanks are hit by two AoEs at once, they will likely die. To tell the order of the collisions and their AoEs, players must eye the distance of the tethers and the colors of the orbs instead of relying on the orange AoE indicators, which only briefly appears before the AoEs resolve.If theFrozen Starscollide first, stand under them and quickly run away from the imminent detonation of theBurning StarsIf theBurning Starscollide first, run away from them and then quickly run under theFrozen Starsbefore they detonate as well.UsingSprintis recommended.Ice Collides First: Start in the middle of the room, and once the ice donut AoE goes off, run to the wall away from all the fire spheres.Fire Collides First: Start near the wall away from all the fire spheres, and once they explode, run to the middle of the room. Don't start directly at the wall so you won't need to run as far.Universal Manipulation: Causes room-wide damage and five debuffs. As ofPatch 6.3, there no portals to hide in and avoid this, and the debuffs will detonate the following mechanics:Bleeding: Players take damage overtime until the debuff expires.Ancient Circle: Upon expiring, this creates a massive donut AoE around each player. They should stack in the center to ensure the donut AoEs do not spread there.Dark Whispers: Upon expiring, this creates a purple AoE circle on each player, who should spread out to avoid overlapping.Ancient Frost: Upon expiring, the afflicted player will find themselves the victim of a stack marker.Burning Chains: Upon expiring, players are chained by pairs and must run away from each other to break them.Entropic Flame: A line stack marker.Arcane Revelation: A reprisal ofLahabrea's ultimate fromThe Ultimate Weapon. Ascian Prime becomes untargettable, summons a largeArcane Sphere, and begins siphoning power from it to fill anAscian Prime's Powergauge. Meanwhile, untargettable Shades ofLahabreaandIgeyorhmperiodically appear to unleash mechanics on the partyChilling CrossandDark Fire II:Igeyorhm's shadecreates cross line AoEs from the middle of the arena whileLahabrea's shadeplaces purple AoE circles on players.Dark Blizzard IIandDark Fire II:Igeyorhm's shadecreates several frozen line AoEs whileLahabrea's shadeplaces purple AoE circles on players.Shadow Flare: Both Shades cast this at the same time, dealing extra raidwide damage.Annihilation: Heavy raid-wide damage based on how far theAscian Prime's Powergauge filled. If Ascian Prime was allowed to reach 100%, his attack will wipe the partyAncient Eruption: Ascian Prime causes AoE circles to appear underneath each player.From there, the mechanics repeat themselves until the boss is defeated.LootRegula van Hydrus15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsHarmachis30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsLahabrea&Igeyorhm45Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsAscian Prime60Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityFaded Copy of ImaginationOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1100Allagan Tomestone of Poeticsfor first time completionAchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Aetherochemical Research Facility10Discover every location inthe Aetherochemical Research Facility.-3.0ImagesDungeon ImagesOther ImagesDungeon Dialogue Infographic Part 1 (credits:TrustInsighters)Dungeon Dialogue Infographic Part 2Dungeon Dialogue Infographic Part 3LoreThe Study Of EikonsThe ancient Allagan civilization rose to greatness through the blessings of aetherochemistry, and in order to advance this field of science born of the union between magic and technology, they built the Aetherochemical Research Facility. Originally situated near present-day Mor Dhona, it was relocated to Azys Lla towards the end of the Third Astral Era. Information recently deciphered from tomestones revealed that the move came about with the commencement of research into eikon suppression. Following debate over ways to protect the facility’s secrets, isolation was settled upon as the best solutionAs would be confirmed millennia later with Azys Lla’s discovery, the Allagans' efforts bore fruit. In addition to sectors dedicated to automachina and bioweapon research, the facility housed what was called Triad Control, which served to restrain and imprison actual eikons. Covetous of this power, the Garlean Empire dispatched the VIth Imperial Legion and its flagship, the Gratio, to the floating continent that it might avail itself of the ancients' secrets.Regula van HydrusLegatus of the VIth Imperial Legion, Regula has long been a close friend of Emperor Varis, and his loyalty to his liege is absolute. In return, Varis has absolute trust in Regula, and thus did he charge him with leading the expedition to retrieve the secrets of eikon suppression on Azys Lla.Ascian PrimeCalling upon the power of the Echo to break down the barriers of their souls, the Ascians Lahabrea and Igeyorhm merged into a single entity. As one, they proved far more formidable than the sum of their individual forms, and were capable of wielding the mightiest magicks with fearsome ease. Thus freed from their mortal restraints, they assumed a ghastly appearance befitting the servants of Darkness.MoreEven after five thousand years, many parts of the facility were miraculously found tobe fully functional. The Sons of Saint Coinach posit that the Allagans likely employed temporal magicks, which they studied in the twilight of the Third Astral Era, to place certain contraptions into stasis.DialogueDuty Support DialogueScion Marauder:This place just keeps getting weirder...Scion Thaumaturge:Aye, it's downright uncanny here.Scion Conjurer:Sentinels!?Regula van Hydrus:No sooner do I clear away the rabble...Scion Marauder:If it isn't an imperial legatus!Regula van Hydrus:Let's get this over with, shall we?Regula van Hydrus:Turrets, deploy!Regula van Hydrus:Your reputation is well deserved.
