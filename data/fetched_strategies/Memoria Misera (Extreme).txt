Should any player touch these glowing walls for any reason, they will suffer various detrimental effects viaConfines Of Memory(see below). Throughout the encounter, players will also need to pay attention to the duty gauge (Charge) which will appear when Varis casts specificGunshieldabilities. However,Gunshieldabilities will not be executed until the gauge has been fully charged.Below is a list of all abilities used by Varis yae Galvus during the encounter, followed by a mechanical timeline so you'll know what to expect (and when), starting with theGunshieldabilities.Outer Wall & Gunshield AbilitiesConfines Of Memory- affects any player who touches the outer edge of the arena. Once touched, the affected player(s) will be encased in a glowing rock prison, rendering them completely unable to act. Whilst locked down, players will also suffer heavy damage-over-time. Fellow raid members can save trapped teammates by destroying the prison as soon as possible (which doesn't have a lot of health).(Charged) Loaded Gunshield- executed once the duty gauge (Charge) reaches maximum. Once charged, all members of the raid will suffer moderate damage and unleash a medium-sized circle AoE at their current locations. As a result, all members of the raid should spread out before theChargereaches maximum to avoid overlap.(Charged) Reinforced Gunshield- executed once the duty gauge (Charge) reaches maximum. Once charged, Varis will deploy two shields on opposite sides of himself (such as front & rear, or to his sides). Once deployed, any player who inflicts damage upon a shielded side of the boss will receive a hefty knockback and debuffs. BeforeReinforced Gunshieldhas been executed, players should cease damage give themselves enough time to recognize which sides of the boss will be shielded, then resume damage on the unshielded sides.(Charged) Electrified Gunshield- executed once the duty gauge (Charge) reaches maximum. Once fully charged, all players will be knocked back from Varis' current location. To avoid being punted into the outer walls, players can utilizeknockback immunity cooldownsor simply position themselves in the centre of the arena.Gunshield abilities are typically used as phase-openers or mini-phases, forcing players to react to a combination of other mechanics while waiting for the duty gauge to reach maximum before the Gunshield itself goes off.Phase 1: AbilitiesAltius- inflicts unavoidable raid-wide damage and causes all players to leave an x-shaped marker at their current locations (facing in the direction that players were facing at the time).Altiusis always followed closely byTerminus Est(see below).Terminus Est- causes all x-shaped markers (spawned viaAltius) to shoot large straight-line AoE's across the arena in the direction the markers are facing. Seeing as the x-shaped markers are dependant on player positioning and look-direction, the raid can bait the straight-line AoE's so that they shoot in an overlapped fashion, giving the raid plenty of space to avoid them. The most common method is to have the entire raid (except the main tank) stand behind Varis, facing the main tank, who will be in front of Varis and facing the raid. AfterAltiushas been cast and the markers have been placed, the entire group can rotate to Varis' sides while the straight-line AoE's shoot towards each-other.Alea Iacta Est- causes Varis to unleash four consecutive 180-degree cone attacks in the direction he is facing, followed by one final (delayed) attack directly behind himself. All attacks fromAlea Iacta Estcan cover the entire arena, thus the only way to avoid being sliced is to stand directly behind Varis during the first four swipes, then re-position in front of him before the final backward slash. Bear in mind - the firstTerminus Est(x-markers) will not resolve until afterAlea Iacta Esthas concluded.Citius- a large, shareable, forward-cleaving tank-buster against Varis' main target. The main tank can utilize immunity cooldowns to absorb the cleave individually, or stack with the off-tank to share the damage. Meanwhile, all non-tanks should avoid standing in front of Varis duringCitiusas they will suffer tremendous (typically fatal) damage if cleaved.Ignis Est- causes Varis to turn towards a random non-tank player and aim a short-ranged telegraph in their direction. After a brief delay, Varis will shoot a large straight-line AoE in the direction of the telegraph whilst simultaneously unleashing a moderate point-blank AoE at his current location. Players can baitIgnis Estby stacking together so that once a player has been targeted, the entire raid can move away from the boss and out of the direction of the telegraph to avoid the point-blank AoE and straight-line AoE. Assuming Varis is in the centre of the arena at the time, players can use the pattern on the arena floor as a visual indicator of how big the circle AoE will be. Bear in mind that the firstIgnis Estwill conclude at the exact same time asFestina Lente(see below).Festina Lente- places a stack-marker on both healers that will need to be shared, preferably by splitting the raid into even halves (3 per healer). After a brief delay, each healer will be blasted by moderate-sized AoE circles, thus it is wise to have each healer stand a safe distance away from the other. Bear in mind that the firstFestina Lenteconcludes at the same time asIgnis Est, thus the raid will need to split in half (with one healer per half) and soakFestina Lente(stack markers) while avoiding the point-blank AoE and the straight-line AoE fromIgnis Estat the exact same time.Ventus Est- practically identical toIgnis Est(see above), except Varis will utilize a donut AoE instead of a point-blank AoE (as well as the aimed straight-line AoE in the direction of a random player). Just likeIgnis Est, the straight-line AoE can be baited by the raid, and the pattern on the arena floor is a good visual indicator of how large the safe-spot for the donut AoE will be.Vivere Militare Est- begins a small cutscene of Varis leaping out of the arena and shooting two x-shaped pulses from his gunblade towards the raid. Once the animation has ended, each tank will need to click on one of two markers near the centre of the arena to 'catch' a pulse each, locking them within anactive time manoeuvre. Once caught, tanks will need to mash buttons whilst the rest of the group destroys each pulse. Healers beware - both tanks will be taking bleed damage for the duration of the event and the entire raid will also be suffering frequent pulses of unavoidable damage.Vivere Militare Estis essentially a phase-ending DPS check. If the pulses have not been destroyed before Varis reaches maximum charge, the entire raid will be slain. If the pulses are successfully destroyed, the battle transitions into the second phase.Phase 2: AbilitiesVaris returns to the platform and begins to cycle between threeGunshieldmini-phases in random order. Each mini-phase is comprised of various previously used mechanics in combination (with some added dangers). Below are all possible phases, though as mentioned, the order they appear in will be entirely random, so watch out!(Mini-Phase) - Electrified Gunshield:Varis will summonreinforcementsin the form of five magitek turrets - two untargetable and three targetable. The three targetable turrets will begin to shoot straight-line AoE's in the direction of random players until destroyed. Meanwhile, the two untargetable turrets will tether themselves to random players and blast them for a large amount of damage. Each tether can be taken by (or given to) other players, thus they should be intercepted by each tank as soon as possible.After the turrets have been summoned, players will also notice clones of Varis carving multiple x-shaped markers at the northern edge of the arena. Just like the x-shaped markers fromAltius / Terminus Est, each one will fire straight-line AoE's across the arena. However, there will always be an obvioussafe lanefor the raid to utilize.Lastly, the duty gauge (Charge) will be filling up throughout the mini-phase. Once fully charged, Varis will unleash an unavoidable knock-back against the entire raid, followed byAlea Iacta Est- four consecutive 180-degree cone attacks in the direction Varis is facing, then one final (delayed) attack directly behind himself.Note that immediately afterAlea Iacta Estresolves, if the targetable turrets are still alive, they will explode, dealing ~25k damage and applying a stack of Vulnerability to the entire raid.In summary, the group will need to quickly destroy targetable turrets as soon as possible. Meanwhile, both tanks will need to grab tethers from the two un-targetable turrets. Soon after, the entire raid will need to identify thesafe laneprovided by x-shaped markers to the north, then position themselves (or useknockback immunity cooldowns) to avoid being pushed into the outer walls of the arena. Lastly, the entire raid will need to stand behind Varis to avoid the four 180-degree slashes, then move in front of him to avoid the final backward slash. Once allAlea Iacta Estslashes have concluded, the mini-phase ends.(Mini-Phase) - Loaded Gunshield:Varis will target a random player withIgnis Est, which is handled in the exact same manner as it was in the first phase. However, multiple clones of Varis will also spawn at the northern side of the arena - each one creating aAltius / Terminus Estx-shaped marker that will eventually shoot straight-line AoE's across the platform. There will always be an obvioussafe lanefor the raid to utilize, though bear in mind - everyone should avoid moving to the safe lane untilIgnis Est(telegraphed straight-line AoE + point-blank AoE from Varis) has concluded.As soon as the straight-line + point-blank AoE's have detonated,Festina Lentewill create a stack-marker on each healer, just like in the first phase. The raid will need to split in half and stack with their respective healer to soak the upcoming damage (within the safe-lane). As such, one healer should move to the north of the safe lane (with three other players) while the other healer moves to the south (with the remaining three players) so that the stack-markers do not cause any overlap.OnceFestina Lentehas concluded and the clones have fired their straight-line AoE's, Varis will unleashCitius- the forward cleaving tank-buster. Tanks will need to decide whether to soakCitiusindividually using an immunity cooldown, or stack together to share the damage. Meanwhile, all non-tanks should position themselves behind Varis to avoid being cleaved.In summary, the raid can bait the initialIgnis Estjust like they did in the first phase. Once the telegraph appears, clones will be summoned to the north, giving the raid enough time to identify the safe-lane (wherever a clone is missing). After dodging the straight-line AoE and circle-AoE fromIgnis Est, players can start moving towards the safe-line, dividing into two groups, each stacked with a healer to absorb the upcomingFestina Lente. Once the stack-markers explode, all players (except the tanks) should move behind Varis to avoid his cleaving tank-buster, while the tanks decide whether to soak it as a duo or utilize an immunity cooldown to soak it individually. OnceCitiushas concluded, the mini-phase ends.(Mini-Phase) - Reinforced Gunshield:Varis begins the mini-phase by casting anAltius+Terminus Estcombo that is handled in the exact same manner as the first phase. As a quick refresher:Altiusinflicts unavoidable raid-wide damage and causes all players to leave an x-shaped marker at their current locations (facing in the direction that players were facing at the time). Shortly afterwards,Terminus Estcauses all x-shaped markers to shoot straight-line AoE's in the direction they are facing. As such, players can easily bait markers into shooting towards each-other, leaving plenty of space for the raid to rotate around Varis into safe areas.After the initial combo has concluded, Varis will create two shields (either to the front & rear or to his sides), forcing the raid to avoid damaging the shielded sides. Simultaneously, Varis will useVentus- creating a donut AoE that will cleave any player who is not standing in the centre of the arena.As soon asVentus(donut AoE) has concluded, Varis will unleashCitius- the forward cleaving tank-buster. As usual, everyone except the two tanks should make sure that they are not standing in-front of Varis at this time. It is up to the tanks how they wish to handleCitius- either by stacking together to soak the damage or having one tank soak it themselves via an immunity cooldown. OnceCitiushas concluded, the mini-phase ends.In summary, the raid can bait theAltius + Terminus Estopener by having the entire raid (except the main tank) stand behind Varis, facing the main tank, who will be in front of Varis and facing the raid. AfterAltiushas been cast and the markers have been placed, the entire group can rotate to Varis' sides while the straight-line AoE's harmlessly shoot towards each-other. However, don't forget to remain in the centre of the arena to avoid being cleaved byVentus(donut AoE)!After all AoE's have been fired, all non-tanks should move behind Varis to avoid the cleaving tank-buster, while the tanks decide whether to soak it as a duo or utilize an immunity cooldown to soak it individually. OnceCitiushas concluded, the mini-phase ends.As soon as Varis has cycled through all threeGunshieldphases, he will leap to the north of the arena and begin to hard-castAltius(initiating a DPS check). While doing so, Varis will be protected by a destroyable shield. As soon as the shield has been summoned, it will utilizeMagitek TorchandMagitek Sparkin random order.Magitek Torch- bombards the raid with a massive blast of shareable damage - the brunt of which will be focused on those closest to the shield. The entire raid will need to stack together in order to survive the damage, preferably behind both tanks.Magitek Spark- shoots straight-line cleaves towards all members of the raid simultaneously, inflicting heavy damage and debuffs. The entire raid will need to spread out in a semi-circle as quickly as possible so that their individual cleave doesn't overlap other players (which will likely be fatal).Remember:the order of these two mechanics is entirely random. Depending on which is cast first, the raid will need to stack together (then quickly spread out), or vice versa, whilst maintaining uptime on theMagitek Shield.Phase 3: AbilitiesAfter destroying the Magitek Shield, Varis will leap to the centre of the arena and immediately castLoaded Gunshield, which will not detonate until the duty gauge (Charge) has reached maximum. Once cast, the final phase of the battle begins with another rotation of mini-phases - this time in a set order.(Mini-Phase) - Loaded Gunshield #2Fortius- causes Varis to slash at the raid via four cleaves -- the first of which is unavoidable and causes all players to drop a persistent puddle at their locations. The remaining three cleaves will be done in the same pattern as the previous, except now, they will rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. While initially being cast, players will notice a rotation-marker on Varis himself, indicating which direction the cleaves will rotate after the initial hit.Due to the initial 'aimed' component (and the upcomingLoaded Gunshield), all players should spread out to pre-assigned cardinal and inter-cardinal locations around Varis (at the far edges of the arena). This allows the raid to drop their puddles out of harm's way and also causes the initial cleave to form a predictable star-shaped pattern. Once the first unavoidable cleave has been unleashed, Varis will repeatedly cleave the previous pattern in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion. By standing still, the raid will automatically dodge the second cleave, and can simply side-step the following two cleaves.Once all four cleaves have resolved, the duty gauge (Charge) will reach maximum, unleashingLoaded Gunshield. Thanks to already being at pre-assigned cardinal and inter-cardinal positions, all members of the raid will safely detonate their circle AoE's away from one another. Having avoided all cleaves, Varis will utilizeFestina Lenteonce more, creating a stack-marker on each healer just like in the first phase. The raid will need to split in half and stack with their respective healer to soak the upcoming damage much like they did for all previous casts ofFestina Lente. Once concluded, Varis will unleash anotherCitius- the forward cleaving tank-buster. Tanks will need to decide whether to soakCitiusindividually using an immunity cooldown, or stack together to share the damage. Meanwhile, all non-tanks should position themselves behind Varis to avoid being cleaved.(Mini-Phase) - Electrified Gunshield #2Causes Varis to unleash another round ofFortius(see above), except this time, clones of Varis will also form at the northern edge of the arena, creating x-shaped markers that will eventually shoot across the platform (except for one 'safe lane'). Thankfully, the x-shaped markers will not fire untilFortiushas resolved. However, onceFortiushas concluded, theElectrified Gunshieldduty gauge will hit maximum, inflicting a raid-wide knockback from Varis himself.Players can either move to the 'safe lane' onceFortiushas concluded and utilizeknockback immunities, or position themselves so that the knockback from Varis will push them into the safe lane. Don't forget -- the initial cleave fromFortiusrequires players to leave persistent puddles within the arena, and being knocked into the outer-wall will inflictCosmo Memory, which may make 'aimed knockback' problematic. As such, it is infinitely easier to keep yourknockback immunity cooldowns.From here, Varis will initiate waves of previously witnessed mechanics one after another (or sometimes in tandem), but nothing you haven't seen before. The order of these abilities will be described in themechanical timelinebelow.Should Varis survive long enough, he will utilize an enraged version ofAltiusafter a final round ofFortius(rotational cleaves), which will wipe the raid if Varis isn't slain in time.Mechanical TimelinePhase OneNow that each mechanic and mini-phase has been explained, here's a run-down of the mechanical timeline so you can see which abilities are used in which order.Altius- raid-wide damage, causing all players to leave x-shaped markers at their locations (facing in the direction that players were facing at the time).Terminus Est- all x-shaped markers simultaneously fire straight-line AoE's in the direction they are facing.Alea Iacta Est- four consecutive 180-degree cone attacks directly in front of Varis, followed by one cone attack directly behind him.Citius- a vicious, cleaving, soakable tank-buster.Ignis Est- aims a telegraphed straight-line AoE at a random player that will detonate at the same time as a point-blank AoE from Varis.Festina Lente- marks each healer with an AoE stack-marker, forcing the raid to split in half.Electrified Gunshield (Charging)- knockback - won't be executed until the duty gauge reaches 100.Altius- raid-wide damage, creating another wave of x-shaped markers.Ignis Est- aims a telegraphed straight-line AoE at a random player that will detonate at the same time as a point-blank AoE from Varis. Resolves at the same time as the x-shaped markers fromAltius.Electrified Gunshield (Charged)- inflicts knockback from Varis.Reinforced Gunshield (Charging)- 2x direction-based shields - won't be executed until the duty gauge reaches 100.Citius- a vicious, cleaving, soakable tank-buster.Reinforced Gunshield (Charged)- direction-based shields spawn at either the front & rear (or sides) of Varis for 3-4 seconds, inflicting damage, knockback and debuffs against anyone who hits the shielded side of Varis.Loaded Gunshield (Charging)- circle AoE's on all raid members - won't be executed until the duty gauge reaches 100.Ventus Est- same asIgnist Est, except the point-blank AoE from Varis is replaced by a donut AoE.Loaded Gunshield (Charged)- all players simultaneously detonate via a moderate-sized circle AoE. Make sure you are not stacked with other players once the duty gauge reaches 100.Vivere Militare Est- minor cutscene of Varis shooting two pulses at the raid, leading to a DPS check. Each tank will need to click an object to 'block' a pulse, locking them into anActive Time Manoeuvreuntil the rest of the raid destroys both pulses. Raid wipes if pulses aren't destroyed in time.Phase TwoVaris will cycle between three differentGunshield Mini-Phasesin random order.If -- (Mini-Phase) - Electrified Gunshield:Reinforcements- spawns five turrets - two untargetable and three targetable. Targetable turrets unleash straight-line AoE's at random players until they are destroyed. Untargetable turrets will tether to a random player and blast them for high damage. Tethers should be picked up by tanks.Terminus Est Clones- creates multiple x-shaped markers at the northern edge of the arena that will eventually fire across the platform. One 'safe lane' will be present.Electrified Gunshield (Charged)- inflicts knockback from Varis.Alea Iacta Est- four consecutive 180-degree cone attacks directly in front of Varis, followed by one cone attack directly behind him.If (Mini-Phase) - Loaded Gunshield:Ignis Est- aims a telegraphed straight-line AoE at a random player that will detonate at the same time as a point-blank AoE from Varis.Loaded Gunshield (Charged)- all players simultaneously detonate via a moderate-sized circle AoE.Terminus Est Clones- creates multiple x-shaped markers at the northern edge of the arena that will eventually fire across the platform. One 'safe lane' will be present.Festina Lente- marks each healer with an AoE stack-marker, forcing the raid to split in half whilst inside the 'safe lane'.Citius- a vicious, cleaving, soakable tank-buster.If (Mini-Phase) - Reinforced Gunshield:Altius- raid-wide damage, causing all players to leave x-shaped markers at their locations.Ventus Est- same asIgnist Est, except the point-blank AoE from Varis is replaced by a donut AoE.Reinforced Gunshield (Charged)'- direction-based shields spawn at either the front & rear (or sides) of Varis for 3-4 seconds.Ventusdonut AoE will conclude whilst the shields are active.Citius- a vicious, cleaving, soakable tank-buster.After all threeGunshieldphases have concluded, another mini-phase takes place.DPS CHECK- Varis is protected by a destroyable shield whilst long-casting a raid-wipeAltius. The shield must be destroyed beforehand. Said shield will useMagitek TorchandMagitek Sparkin a random order.Magitek Spark- shield fires a straight-line cleave towards all players simultaneously. Raid must spread out to avoid overlap.Magitek Torch- fires a shareable straight-line AoE that must be soaked. Raid should stand behind the tanks while doing so due to proximity-based component.Assuming the shield is destroyed in time, the final phase begins.Phase ThreeLoaded Gunshield (Charging)- circle AoE's on all raid members - won't be executed until the duty gauge reaches 100.Fortius- shoots straight-line AoE's at all players simultaneously in an unavoidable (aimable) fashion and causes all players to drop puddles at their location. After the first cleave, the remaining three cleaves will be done in the same pattern as before, rotating clockwise or counter-clockwise).Loaded Gunshield (Charged)- all players simultaneously detonate via a moderate-sized circle AoE.Festina Lente- marks each healer with an AoE stack-marker, forcing the raid to split in half.Electrified Gunshield (Charging)- knockback - won't be executed until the duty gauge reaches 100.Terminus Est Clones- creates multiple x-shaped markers at the northern edge of the arena that will eventually fire across the platform. One 'safe lane' will be present. Will not resolve until after the next two mechanics.Fortius- the quad, rotating, puddle-creating cleaves from earlier.Electrified Gunshield (Charged)- inflicts knockback from Varis, followed by theTerminus Est Clonesfiring across the arena.Altius- raid-wide damage, causing all players to leave x-shaped markers at their locations.Terminus Est Clones- creates multiple x-shaped markers at the northern edge of the arena that will eventually fire across the platform. One 'safe lane' will be present.Festina Lente- marks each healer with an AoE stack-marker, forcing the raid to split in half within the 'safe lane'.Alea Iacta Est+Ventus Est- four consecutive 180-degree cone attacks directly in front of Varis, followed by one cone attack directly behind him, along with a donut AoE at Varis location.Terminus Estresolves at the exact same time.Citius- vicious, cleaving, soakable tank-buster.Ignis Est- aims a telegraphed straight-line AoE at a random player that will detonate at the same time as a point-blank AoE from Varis. Will not resolve untilAlea Iacta Est(below).Alea Iacta Est- four consecutive 180-degree cone attacks directly in front of Varis, followed by one cone attack directly behind him.ENRAGE - Altius Long-Cast- Varis must be slain before this goes off or the raid will wipe.Loaded Gunshield (Charging)- circle AoE's on all raid members - won't be executed until the duty gauge reaches 100.Fortius- shoots straight-line AoE's at all players simultaneously in an unavoidable (aimable) fashion and causes all players to drop puddles at their location. After the first cleave, the remaining three cleaves will be done in the same pattern as before, rotating clockwise or counter-clockwise).Loaded Gunshield (Charged)- all players simultaneously detonate via a moderate-sized circle AoE.ENRAGE - Altius- detonates, wiping the raid.LootSee also:Idealized ArmorEach player will receive 2High Legatus Idolper kill.
