Unfortunately, for reasons beyond your knowing, two of the sacred treasures stored in the isle's vault "reacted" to the presence of the Yasakani-no-Magatama, summoning forth from the aether the great kamiSusano—a primal by another name. How fortunate that you had the wisdom and foresight to invite several of your fellow adventurers on this journey to the Far East, and how kind they were to agree to help you torment the Red Kojin, for no single warrior, no matter how blessed or powerful, could ever hope to slay a primal on their own, despite what some wandering minstrels would have you believe.— In-game descriptionThe Pool of Tributeis a level 63trialintroduced inpatch 4.0withStormblood.Contents1Strategy1.1Lord of the Revel: Susano1.2Phase 11.3Phase 21.4Phase 32Loot3ImagesStrategyLord of the Revel:SusanoUpdated Shadowbringers GuideThe Pool of Tribute - Lv.63 Trial GuideMany of the mechanics during this fight are simplified by having the Main Tank hold Susano in place while the rest of the party stacks behind him. Susano calls some of his attacks with a set phrase.Phase 1Assail- Untelegraphed tankbuster with no cast bar that deals moderate damageRasen Kaikyo- Places a circular AoE under each party member. Being hit will inflict a stack ofLightning Resistance Down.Yata No Kagami- "The seas part for we alone!" - A player will be marked (Red). After a short time, they will be damaged and knocked back. The path of their knockback will determine the safe area of the platform-wide AoE that follows. This AoE appliesLightning Resistance Down.Brightstorm- Immediately following Yata No Kagami, a stack marker will appear on the previously marked party member. Stack to share damage.Dark Cloud- Susano will periodically spawn Dark Clouds. These clouds will each cast a wide line AoE (The Parting Clouds) that inflictParalysis.At around 65%, Susano will start Phase 2Phase 2"How our hearts sing in  the chaos!"At the beginning of Phase 2, a flower-shaped crystal will appear on the platform. A Tank should pick this up as the player who picks it up will be the one receiving continuous damage from Susano during this phase.Clashing- The player that picked up the flower-shaped crystal will be locked in a clash with Susano, receiving a damage-over-timeFlesh Wounddebuff for as long as Ame-no-Murakumo is alive.Ame-no-Murakumo- While clashing, Susano will begin casting this ability. Successful casting, of if the Clashing player dies, will cause a wipe. The party should focus damage on the sword to interrupt this cast.Sheer Force- During the clash, orbs will spawn on the perimeter of the platform. The off-tank should run into these orbs before they get to the party, as they do splash damage.This ends in unavoidable damage (a wipe if Ame-no-Murakumo is not destroyed), marked by a large, red line AoE across the platform. Anyone standing in the red line will die.Phase 3All abilities from Phase 1 are present during this phase.Stormsplitter- Line AoE Tankbuster. Pop mitigation cooldowns.Ama-no-iwato- "Earth and stone at our beck and call!" - Susano will trap a player in a chained stone, giving them theFettersdebuff. Two "dummy stones" will also spawn. The stone containing the player will be marked and then the stones will be shuffled. Only the stone containing a player needs to be destroyed. If the stone finishes casting 'The Sealed Gate', the trapped player will die.The correct stone is always the bottom-most target in the enemy list.Ukehi- Moderate party-wide damage that can hit 1 or 2 times.LootSusano Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)ImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
