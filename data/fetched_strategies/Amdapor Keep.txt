However, as is oft the case with peoples who fancy themselves gods, the self-assuring hubris of the Amdapori eventually became their downfall, and as quickly as they rose to power, did they disappear from the world. For generations, this relic of their once-mighty civilization has remained hidden in plain sight─cloaked by the elementals who sought only to prevent newer generations from stumbling across the ancient Amdapori magicks. That is, until the Lambs of Dalamud─a dark cult who worships the now-fallen lesser moon as a god─dispelled the elementals' glamour by means unknown, and claimed the keep as their own. Now the crazed followers use its ancient chambers to perform blood sacrifices in an effort to resurrect their evil lord.— In-game descriptionAmdapor Keepis a level 50dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.Contents1Objectives2Enemies3Bosses3.1Psycheflayer3.2Demon Wall3.3Anantaboga4Loot4.1Psycheflayer4.2Demon Wall4.3Anantaboga4.4Other Loot4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 9.6 Y: 10.1)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 10.5 Y: 10.5)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 15.2 Y: 13.1)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 17.1 Y: 11.1)5Achievements6Images7Lore7.1Voices From The Keep7.2Anantaboga7.3Malefic Resurgence7.4FerdiadObjectivesClear the Gier Hall: 0/1Clear the Bloody Transept: 0/1DefeatAnantaboga: 0/1EnemiesLunatic FollowerSoul CollectorRecluse HippogryphDullahanLunatic PriestHound LightBrontotaurVodoriga SleeperSuccubusSmolenkosBossesPsycheflayerAmdapor Keep GuideAt first only theLunatic Priestis present.

Up to that point blissfully unaware of its existence, the citizens of Gridania were shocked when its sprawling ruins suddenly appeared in the middle of the Twelveswood.Identified as relic of Amdapor, a Fifth Astral Era nation credited with creating white magic, the keep was likely abandoned in the wake of a devastating attack by their archenemies, the Mhachi. Nonetheless, much of the civilization’s ingenuity survived both the carnage and the passage of time to remain in evidence. Aside from their mastery of healing and purification magicks, the Amdapori are noted for their skill at creating arcane entities of stone, the demon wall being a prime specimen. Many such beings served as the keep’s guardians in its heyday—and still did so the day it was rediscovered.Even the presence of such stout defenses, however, did not deter the fanatics of the Lambs of Dalamud, who ventured into the keep and proceeded to use its chambers for their dark rituals.AnantabogaInside the keep, the Lambs of Dalamud sought to bend voidsent to their will. The creature was Anantaboga, and it was presumably among the void army the Mhachi once sent to lay waste to Amdapor. That it had been sealed away suggests that the white mages fell short of destroying it outright.Malefic ResurgenceThough purging the Lambs of Dalamud brought a hard-earned peace unto Amdapor Keep, some mysterious fiend completed the cultists' rites and ushered shadows back into the ruins. Voidsent reveled anew within these walls, their wickedness warping the flora and transforming kindly woodland creatures, even placid herbivores, into bloodthirsty beasts.Sensing the disturbance, Seedseer A-Ruhn-Senna bade the Hearer Adestan seek out the selfsame adventurer who had previously conquered the evil within Amdapor Keep that he might repeat his feats. Most fortuitously, the hero was soon found, and he set forth once more into the ruins to uncover the source of the darkness and rid the Twelveswood of its corrupting influence.FerdiadA high-ranking voidsent summoned by Mhachi voidmages to join the assault on Amdapor. Vanquished by adventurers in Amdapor Keep, he survived to later appear in the Weeping City of Mhach, doing his lord Diabolos’s bidding.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
