The Binding Coil of Bahamut requires players with item level of 82 or higher to enter. Once unlocked, the raidcanbe accessed from theDuty Finder→ Raids → Raids (A Realm Reborn).Note: Because the Coils of Bahamut have a difficulty somewhere between (Extreme) and (Savage), these raids are not included in anyroulette(evenMentor). As such, players queuing viaDuty Finderwill almost never be able to form a party.That being the case, it is recommended that newer players use theParty Finderto seek the assistance of a couple of level-capped players for a "unsync run" using theUnrestricted Partyoption. This will allow players to see the story at an appropriate point in theirMain Scenario Questprogression.
