Though used by ancient Belah'dians as a place to worship the sun goddess, Azeyma, the massive underground structure appears to be far older than his Sixth Astral Era civilization. That, however, did not deter Belah'dian sultans from each adding their own chambers to the original construct to a bid to achieve immortality through creation. In the subsequent years since the fall of Belah'dia, many an adventurer has sought to explore the temple's mysteries and perhaps return with the treasure of a lost era... Only to fall victim to one of the complex traps set to prevent that very thing from happening.— In-game descriptionThe Sunken Temple of Qarnis a level 35dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.Contents1Objectives2Walkthrough2.1Optional Bonus Rooms2.2Scales of Judgment3Bosses3.1Teratotaur3.2Temple Guardian3.3Adjudicator3.3.1Mythril Verge3.3.2Sun Juror3.3.3Other Abilities4Bestiary5Loot5.1Teratotaur5.2Temple Guardian5.3Adjudicator5.4Treasure Coffers5.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 13.0 Y: 10.1)5.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 13.0 Y: 12.3)5.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 14.2 Y: 10.3)5.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 15.0 Y: 10.4)5.4.5Treasure Coffer 5 (X: 12.9 Y: 11.1)5.4.6Treasure Coffer 6 (X: 14.2 Y: 12.1)5.4.7Treasure Coffer 7 (X: 15.1 Y: 10.4)6Achievements7Images8Lore8.1The Temple To The Sun Goddess8.2Temple Guardian8.3The Perils Of Nenekko8.4Vicegerent to the WardenObjectivesClear the Oratory of Tatamefu II: 0/1Clear the Rosarium of Lalafuto I: 0/1Clear the Adytum of Lalafuto IV: 0/1Tip the Scales of Judgment: 0/1Defeat theadjudicator: 0/1WalkthroughOptimal pathing for the dungeon is as follows (this skips optional side rooms and requires only opening the minimum number of doors needed to progress to the end):At the start, hug the right wall to prevent aggroing the first group of enemies.Continue onward, defeating enemies in the way.

If no or the incorrect objects are placed, three ofThe Condemnedwill spawn. After defeating them, the door to the final boss will open. If the correct objects are placed, the door to a side room containing an extra treasure coffer will open, in addition to the final boss room.As the loot from the extra chests is usually of little value, many parties will skip collecting the items and will ignore the scales puzzle and earlier side rooms.Visiting all side rooms is required for theMapping the Realm: Sunken Temple of Qarnachievement. Players who wish to obtain this achievement should either communicate with the party that they would like to open all side rooms, or run the dungeon solo withUnrestricted Party(unsyncing) settings when they are of sufficiently high level.BossesThe Sunken Temple of Qarn GuideTeratotaurTeratotaur is the first boss of The Sunken Temple of Qarn. The boss fight has multiple instant death mechanics, involving adds and three square plates positioned around the arena.Instant Death MechanicsOccasionally he summons a pair of Dung Wespes. The Wespes are like theTemple Beesfound throughout the area or Palace Hornets from thePalace of the Dead, and will castFinal Stingif they are not defeated quickly. Final Sting deals damage equal to ninety percent of the target'smaximumhealth (e.g. 100 Max HP = 90 damage). Whilst this is survivable from full health, the Teratotaur may finish off a wounded Tank quite easily - or the Wespes may both target the same character and deal extreme damage to them. Either defeat the wespes before they cast Final Sting or cancel the ability withstunsandinterrupts.When Teratotaur is under 50%HP, he will periodically "begin to growl", and then use Mortal Ray. This room-wide AoE ability places theDoomdebuff on your entire party; the debuff lasts 12 seconds and will instantly kill anyone still afflicted by it when the timer ends. Players can remove this debuff by stepping on the square plate that is glowing orange; only one of them will turn orange at a time. It may be preferable to tank the Teratotaur in the middle of the room between all three plates so that they are within easy reach of the Tank and Melee DPS, but the duration is long enough that it should not be a problem.Other AbilitiesFrightful Roar is a circular AoE ability that causes Physical Vulnerability Up on all of the targets hit.Mow is a frontal cone AoE attack that inflicts poison on targets hit.Triclip is an instant attack that does heavy damage to its primary target.Temple GuardianTemple Guardian is a gigantic rock golem boss. Throughout the fight, Temple Guardian will spawnGolem Soulstoneonto its chest. While the Soulstone is alive, Temple Guardian takes virtually no damage. When theGolem Soulstoneis destroyed, the golem isstunnedand becomes vulnerable for a period of time before the Soulstone respawns. Players should switch their target to the Soulstone when it spawns. The Guardian will target random players with most of his abilities. To save time, it is recommended to use a DPS (preferably melee) limit break on the Guardian to increase the chances of killing it when it becomes vulnerable the first time, before the Soulstone respawns.AbilitiesRockslide is a frontal column AoE attack that deals massive amount of damage to targets hit.True Grit is a frontal cone AoE attack that deals moderate amount of damage to targets hit.Boulder Clap is a frontal AoE attack that deals massive amount of damage to targets hit.Obliterate is an instant attack that deals a moderate amount of damage to the entire party.Stone Skull is an instant attack that deals a moderate amount of damage to a single player and stuns them for a short period of time.AdjudicatorAdjudicatoris the final boss of The Sunken Temple of Qarn. Throughout the fight, he will spawn various Mythril Verges on the ground.Mythril VergeWhen the Mythril Verge spawns, it will start firing beams of laser across the room. When a pale, blue beam appears across the ground, move out of its way immediately. The beam will light up after about 1 second and heavily damage anyone in its path. Because of the high damage and low health nature of the Mythril Verge, damage dealers should destroy them as soon as they spawn.Avoid blue beams and destroy verges asap.After the Adjudicator has taken some damage, he will spawn Verge in a large dark box on the ground. After a few seconds the black box will seal off and the Verge will begin to cast Verge Pulse. Verge Pulse explodes the Verge and does a decent amount of damage to your entire party. While the black box is visible, players who are not in it will do reduced damage. Damage Dealers should enter the black box as soon as it spawns and destroy the verge.Players should enter the black box as soon as it spawns and destroy the verge.After taking a significant amount of damage, the Adjudicator will spawn 2 black boxes in the 2 corners of the room. The two damage dealers should split up and enter the two boxes and destroy the verges before they can cast Verge Pulse.When near death, Adjudicator will summon 4 laser-shooting Mythril Verge at a time. Players should dodge the lasers while taking out as many Verges as they can. DPSing down the boss is also an option.Sun JurorIn the beginning of the fight, the Adjudicator will spawn cube-shaped mobs named Sun Jurors. When fighting these creatures, players need to ensure that the mobs die on the square platforms on the ground. If you do not kill them on the platforms, they will continuously revive. No more Sun Jurors will spawn once the Mythril Verges start spawning.Other AbilitiesDarknessis a frontal AoE cone attack that will damage and blind the players struck.Paralyzeis a spell he will periodically begin casting that inflictsParalysison one of your party members. This can beInterruptedwith eitherInterjectorHead GrazeorStunnedviaLow BloworLeg Sweep. Healers should useEsunaon an afflicted player to remove the debuff.Creeping Darknessis an instant ability that deals a moderate amount of damage to all party members.BestiaryNameDropsAdjudicatorAvoirdupoisDeath ClawDung WespeGolem SoulstoneMythril VergeQarn FacerSun JurorTemple BatTemple BeeFinal StingTemple CrocTemple GuardianTeratotaurThe AccusedThe CondemnedWall CrawlerLootSee also:Qarn WeaponsandQarn ArmorTeratotaurNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityQarn CircletHead37BGreen1Qarn GlovesHands37BGreen1Qarn GogglesHead37BGreen1Qarn HalfglovesHands37BGreen1Qarn VambracesHands37BGreen1Temple GuardianNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityQarn Breeches of MagicLegs37BGreen1Qarn Breeches of ResilienceLegs37BGreen1Qarn Breeches of WarLegs37BGreen1Qarn ChainmailBody37BGreen1Qarn CowlBody37BGreen1Qarn JackcoatBody37BGreen1AdjudicatorNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAltairAstrologian's Arm37BGreen1AnathemaOne-handed Thaumaturge's Arm37BGreen1Banos Del SolRogue's Arm37BGreen1Belah'dian GlassMaterialN/AABasic1BloodcryTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm37BGreen1Boar's BaneMarauder's Arm37BGreen1Echoes of Ages Past Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Fists of the Sixth SunPugilist's Arm37BGreen1HellfireMachinist's Arm37BGreen1Kokoroon's NestpickerArcher's Arm37BGreen1Paladin's Flametongue Arms (Lv. 35)OtherN/ABGreen1Platoon SwordDark Knight's Arm37BGreen1Pupil's Book of SilverArcanist's Grimoire37BGreen1Qarn BootsFeet37BGreen1Qarn DuckbillsFeet37BGreen1Qarn JackbootsFeet37BGreen1ShellsplitterLancer's Arm37BGreen1Treasure CoffersTreasure Coffer 1 (X: 13.0 Y: 10.1)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityFire ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Ice ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Wind ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Earth ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Lightning ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Water ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 13.0 Y: 12.3)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityFire ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Ice ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Wind ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Earth ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Lightning ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Water ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 14.2 Y: 10.3)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityFire ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Ice ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Wind ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Earth ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Lightning ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Water ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 15.0 Y: 10.4)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityFire ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Ice ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Wind ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Earth ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Lightning ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Water ShardCrystalN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 5 (X: 12.9 Y: 11.1)Dropped by the firstQarn Faceryou come across.NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPaladin's Flametongue Arms (Lv. 35)OtherN/ABGreen1Boar's BaneMarauder's Arm37BGreen1Platoon SwordDark Knight's Arm37BGreen1ShellsplitterLancer's Arm37BGreen1Fists of the Sixth SunPugilist's Arm37BGreen1Banos Del SolRogue's Arm37BGreen1Kokoroon's NestpickerArcher's Arm37BGreen1HellfireMachinist's Arm37BGreen1AnathemaOne-handed Thaumaturge's Arm37BGreen1Pupil's Book of SilverArcanist's Grimoire37BGreen1BloodcryTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm37BGreen1AltairAstrologian's Arm37BGreen1Treasure Coffer 6 (X: 14.2 Y: 12.1)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityQarn BootsFeet37BGreen1Qarn JackbootsFeet37BGreen1Qarn DuckbillsFeet37BGreen1Belah'dian GlassMaterialN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 7 (X: 15.1 Y: 10.4)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityQarn CircletHead37BGreen1Qarn GogglesHead37BGreen1Qarn VambracesHands37BGreen1Qarn GlovesHands37BGreen1Qarn HalfglovesHands37BGreen1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the following achievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Sunken Temple of Qarn10Discover every location withinthe Sunken Temple of Qarn.-2.0ImagesLoreThe Temple To The Sun GoddessIn the south of sunbaked Thanalan, half devoured by the shifting sands, there lie the ruins of an ancient temple.Formerly used by the Belah'dians as a place to worship the sun goddess, Azeyma, its construction is credited to Tatamefu II, with further expansion taking place over generations under the auspices of sovereigns such as Lalafuto I, Lalafuto III, and Memeto the Meek. Financial woes, however, put a stop to Lalafuto IV's bid to expand underground, and all such  work would be forever ended when a war of succession broke out between two princes and the kingdom was torn in twain.In the years since the fall of Belah'dia, many souls have sought to plumb the temples mysteries, but the devious traps that riddle its halls have frustrated the efforts of explorers and thieves alike.Temple GuardianBrought to life with knowledge inherited from the Mhach civilization, these guardians of stone dutifully and tirelessly attend to those who would defile the temple. To be spared their attentions, one must bear the guise of a genuine worshiper, but few such implements have survived the passage of time.The Perils Of NenekkoOwing to the efforts of sure-footed adventurers, the Sunken Temple of Qarn was made safe, and a partnership between the Order of Nald'thal and Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern sent forth a joint expedition to coax out its secrets.Alas, by then the rumors of hidden treasure had reached the ears of the rapacious and reckless, whose blundering presence in the ruins awakened yet more arcane traps and left the expedition stranded amidst deadly dangers. A team of adventurers familiar with the temple’s workings was promptly dispatched to rescue the civilians, with an express focus on the young scholar Nenekko, daughter to the chairman of Amajina & Sons.Had this mission failed, it is said that the Concern’s private army, the Stone Torches, stood ready to mount its own rescue with the entirety of its resources.Vicegerent to the WardenThis ancient sentinel was accidentally roused in the course of excavation. In contrast to the temple guardian’s rough-hewn appearance, Which marks it as a product of early Beah dia, the vicegerent is a thing of precision created in the kingdoms later years. In this way, it is possible to appreciate the advances made in guardian construction techniques through out the ages.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
