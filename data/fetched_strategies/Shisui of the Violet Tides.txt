Cooldown and heal as necessary.The boss will periodically target a single player and drop a puddle AoE under them, immobilizing the target and any other player near them. The boss will immediately move to the stunned target and begin to castShuckwhich will usually kill the target.While the boss is casting Shuck, one of the boss's legs will become targetable. Destroying the leg interrupts the cast of Shuck, and also sends the boss tumbling onto its back for a few seconds, preventing it from performing any actions and inflictingVulnerability Up.Periodically, aKamikiriadd will spawn and the three non-tank players will be marked forDigest. If Kamikiri spawns while Amikiri is casting Shuck, Digest instead targets the three players not targeted by Shuck. The attack leaves a water puddle under each target, which inflictsDropsyas long as a player stands in it.If the Kamikiri add is slain before Digest's cast completes, the cast is interrupted.Ruby PrincessThe boss will periodically enter the center of the room and begin to castSeduce, which will cause everyone hit by it to slowly walk toward the boss. Immediately after Seduce, the boss will performCoriolis Kick, a large circular AoE, which Seduced players will be hit by.To avoid being hit by Seduce, each player must run into one of the four boxes around the outside of the arena, which will place theOlddebuff on that player. Once touched, the box will be used up until the next Seduce phase, and while one box can affect multiple players, the timing is too precise to be practical. So, each player should pick a box and only use that box, and avoid running into it except to avoid the Seduce effect.The boss will periodically castAbyssal Volcano, which places a large circular AoE as well as marking two players with an AoE which will track them. Affected players should repeatedly run out of this effect, avoiding touching the boxes.The boss periodically castsTornadogenesison its primary target, which deals a moderate amount of damage, Cooldown and heal as necessary.Shisui YohiThe boss will useFoul Nailon its primary target, which does two attacks for moderate damage. Cooldown and heal as necessary.Shisui Yohi will castThick Fog, dealing group-wide damage, filling the arena with water and hiding the boss. Three Churn enemies (bubble adds) will spawn, each applying a stackingDropsydebuff until they are killed. When all three Churns have been killed, Shisui Yohi will re-enter the battlefield.During the Thick Fog phase the boss will move around the arena, look for a large mass of churning ripples. Standing in these bubbles will damage the player. The boss will re-emerge from these ripples.When the boss re-enters the arena after the Churns are destroyed, it will instantly castBlack Tidewhich will deal a moderate amount damage to any player standing near it and debuff any player hit withVulnerability Up. Players should pay attention to the location of the ripples and avoid standing in that area of the arena.Periodically the boss will summon two Shark adds, Naishi-no-jo and Naishi-no-Kami, which lock onto a specific player with a line AoE,Bite and Runwhich will do large amounts of damage will follow the targeted player. These should be killed ASAP, before they can execute their rush attack. The Naishi-no-jo is weaker, and will target a random DPS. The Naishi-no-Kami is stronger and targets the healer, but will take longer to complete its cast.After summoning the shark adds, the boss will castMad Stare, a gaze attack which will debuff affected players withHysteria, making them uncontrollable and wander the arena. Turn away before the cast finishes to avoid the attack.Note that if the Shark adds are still up when the boss enters the next Thick Fog phase, they will be hidden and untargetable, but still perform their rush attacks. This can cause large damage spikes unexpectedly and can lead to wipes.LootSee also:Ruby Tide Weapons,Shisui ArmorandRuby Tide AccessoriesAmikiriNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityRuby Tide Bracelets of

Violet Tides10Discover every location withinShisui of the Violet Tides.-4.0ImagesLoreThe Palace Beneath The SeaNestled on the sands of the Turquoise Trench, a thousand thousand fathoms below the surface of the Ruby Sea, is Shisui of the Violet Tides. A resplendent palace erected by Raen refugees who fled underwater to escape the constant wars that raged upon the land, its unique beauty is nigh unparalleled.The palace is home to the Ruby Princess, ruler of Sui-no-Sato, who oversees religious rites within its sanctified grounds. Barring special leave, entry is forbidden even to citizens, and for long years what lay beyond the gates was shrouded in mystery. With the admittance of one adventurer, however, the world was afforded a rare glimpse beneath the veil. Stepping through the solitary ingress, one first comes upon the beauteous Sogyoku Piscary. A stroll through its coral-lined paths brings one to Harutsuge Gate, beyond which lies Kogyoku Palace, the stately residence of the Ruby Princess. Passing through these apartments, one finally arrives at Shisui Temple, where priests and priestesses conduct ceremonies under Her Grace’s watchful gaze.All of this had become the dominion of a voidsent, and the aforementioned adventurer was called upon to purge its dark presence and rescue the Ruby Princess. By virtue of his valor, we now have more than mere rumors to enlighten us.The Ruby PrincessThe Ruby Princess was found to be under the power of a voidsent, but with the creature’s defeat, she was released from its grip and subsequently made a full recovery. Although the day was saved, in the event that the situation became untenable, one priest was prepared to destroy the dome encasing the palace, thereby engulfing all in the Ruby Sea.Shisui YohiUpon manifesting in the palace, this immense voidsent moved to exert its influence upon the corporeal realm, employing its powerful enthrallment magicks to bring all nearby souls under its control, the Ruby Princess included. It is uncertain whether its tentacled form is its own or the result of its choice of vessel.MoreWhile Shisui’s architectural style resembles those of Hingashi and Doma, in the adornments one may observe touches of the sea. From such differences, it may be stated that the Raen of Sui-no-Sato have established an identity distinct from their land-dwelling kin.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
