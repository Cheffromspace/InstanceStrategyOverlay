Dominating the vibrant cityscape is the majestic Kugane Castle, within whose halls a performance was unfolding, a spectacle to entertain visiting dignitaries. But comedy quickly turned to tragedy when a band of lawless shinobi stormed the castle. Ardently opposed to the influence of foreign nations, these interlopers took all present captive, the lord bugyo of Kugane included. The country now sits on a knife's edge, leaning perilously toward an international incident. Who will see that it falls to the other side?— In-game descriptionKugane Castleis a level 70dungeonintroduced inpatch 4.0withStormblood.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Zuiko-maru2.2Dojun-maru2.3Yojimbo3Loot3.1Zuiko-maru3.2Dojun-maru3.3Yojimbo3.4Additional Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 11.0 Y: 7.2)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 10.3 Y: 9.2)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 11.1 Y: 14.5)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 11.6 Y: 15.8)4Achievements5Images6Lore6.1The Shining Symbol OF Hingashi6.2Dojun-maru6.3Yojimbo6.4MoreObjectivesArrive at the Keisen Garden: 0/1DefeatZuiko-maru: 0/1Arrive at the Budokan Training Grounds: 0/1DefeatDojun-maru: 0/1Arrive at the Noh Theater: 0/1DefeatYojimbo: 0/1BossesKugane Castle Video GuideZuiko-maruAvoid the frontal cone he occasionally casts.Stack when someone is hit with the shareable damage marker.He will spawn up to two bombs at a time that will tether to a player, chase them, and try to bind them. When a bomb is killed, it will stay in place and damage anyone in its radius AoE. Players who get tethered should keep to one side of the room to make it easier to avoid the very large AoE.Healers should prepare to heal through his occasional casts of Kenki Release, which hits the whole party.Dojun-maruAvoid the narrow column AoEs that stretches from one end of the room to the other.Kill the clones as soon as possible to avoid heavy groupwide damage.When marked with the electric circle marker, spread out to avoid catching anyone in more than their own damage AoE.Also uses theBlue MagespellTatami-gaeshi.YojimboDuring the first Payday phase, piles of gold will spawn around the room. His dog will lunge to pick them up, knocking aside anyone in his trajectory, filling the duty gauge with each pile he successfully picks up. Interact with as much gold as you can to pick it up; his dog prioritizes gold in the order in which it drops.
When the Payday phase completes, Yojimbo will deal groupwide damage according to how much the duty gauge has filled.Be ready for occasional groupwide damage from Metta-Giri.Inoshi-Katcho casts circle AoEs on first the center of the room, then the outskirts. Move out of these.Avoid his circle AoE he casts on himself.During the second Payday phase, act as before, but destroy the dragon heads he summons during this phase. They cast column AoEs on players' locations, and don't take much punishment before dying. He may summon dragon heads after the second Payday phase is complete as well; deal with them when that time comes.LootSee also:Crimson Lotus Weapons,Arhat ArmorandArhat AccessoriesZuiko-maru4Allagan

Castle.-4.0ImagesLoreThe Shining Symbol OF HingashiAs the first sight of Hingashi that visitors are like to glimpse, this majestic castle standing guard over the port city of Kugane was built to be visually striking. In a departure from conventional castle design, the keep is situated not behind the walls but in alignment with them, rising atop a separate stone base as the centerpiece of a bridge extending to the north and south.
This layout provides an unobstructed view of the towering keep from the port, and those sailing in can scarcely miss the mitsudomoe emblem of the Mitsurugi clan—the rulers of Hingashi—prominently set upon the structure’s facade.The castle’s uniqueness does not end without. As a stage for diplomacy, it boasts amenities and amusements not seen in utilitarian castles to provide visiting ambassadors and merchants with the finest hospitality. In front of Ni-no-Maru Manor, where dignitaries are welcomed, is the Keisen Garden with its stunning pond. And inside Hon-maru, the castle’s inner ward, are the Budokan Training Grounds and the Noh Theater, which host regular performances to introduce Hingan culture to foreigners.Dojun-maruAs much a showcase of Hingan craftsmanship as a castle guardian, the automaton Dojun-maru was created by a master doll-maker in Bukyo, while its beautiful lacquered armor was the work of Fugetsu, chief armorer of Kokajiya. Alas, a rebel conspirator tampered with its behavioral protocol and turned it against its masters.YojimboThis wandering sellsword served as bodyguard to Kageyama, the unscrupulous soy sauce baron who led the rebels. Though possessed of peerless swordsmanship, he does not draw his prized katana, Zanmato, for aught less than a bugyo’s ransom. He is never seen without his trusty hound, Daigoro.MoreAs a performance was unfolding in the Noh Theater, anti-foreigner rebels stormed the castle and took all present captive. But owing to the swift and valorous actions of adventurers and the Sekiseigumi, these villains were subdued and the hostages freed.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
