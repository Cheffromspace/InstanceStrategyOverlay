Should this plan succeed, not only will the vast quantities of aether absorbed by Eden drain the land of life, but Gaia as you know her will be lost forever. Ryne makes a desperate bid to send you in pursuit, though there is no way of knowing what manner of danger you will face.— In-game descriptionEden's Promise: Eternityis a level 80raidintroduced inpatch 5.4withShadowbringers.

Be immediately left or right of the boss to avoid.Formless Judgement: Both tanks will be marked with large red arrows for a tankbuster single target ability.  No splashing damage or positioning to be aware of.  Cooldowns recommended.Stage 2Platform Stage 1Line Stack Marker + Two Single Target AOE Telegraphs: All non-marked players should stack up in the middle of the room, while the marked players move to either side to position a targeted cone away from the raid.  After the cone telegraph comes out, both players can join the stack.Platform Stage 2Two Stack Markers: Each healer is given a stack marker, indicating a statue add will spawn on them and do light damage. Because the stack AoEs do not inflict vulnerability debuffs on players, it is fine to stack both markers. Once the adds spawn, players will need to defeat the adds.Battlefield Push Telegraph (Side): Run to the edge of the battlefield, being careful not to fall off the edge.  The telegraph extends beyond the battlefield itself so it's best to stay lined at the edge in the middle.Platform Stage 3Battlefield Push Telegraph (Center): Run to the middle of the battlefield to avoid getting blown off the stage.  Heal through the AOE damage and move onto the next platform!Stage 3AbilitiesStock: The boss will absorb a random two of the crystals' energy into them self to be cast at a later time.  Remember which two these were!Release: The boss will cast both stored crystals at the same time, so the space to move is usually much much tighter.  You definitely need to commit the individual patterns to memory so you know where to go.Junction Shiva: The boss will pull energy from Shiva's crystal.  This has no effect, but telegraphs the next series.Diamond Dust: Make sure you spread out before this cast finishes, as the entire battlefield will be covered in ice.  Half the raid's members will be single targeted with AOE markers at this time (if you've spread out, you won't need to move).Rapturous Reach: The boss telegraph a massive cone AOE that'll hit half the of battlefield, in addition to giving everyone in the raid an individual AOE marker.  Move to the correct side of the map, and spread out to avoid overlapping damage.Junction Titan: The boss will pull energy from Titan's crystal.  This has no effect, but telegraphs the next series.Earthen Fury: The boss will place two large boulders on one side of the battlefield, and then two sets of small boulders around the battlefield along the edges.  Stand where the second set of small boulders spawned, and move onto the space where the first boulders were after they explode.  Be on the opposite side of the battlefield from the large boulders!Rapturous Reach: The boss telegraph a massive cone AOE that'll hit half the of battlefield, in addition to giving everyone in the raid an individual AOE marker.  Move to the correct side of the map, and spread out to avoid overlapping damage.Loot20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsEden's Promise Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityArmor of Lost AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Gauntlets of Lost AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Chausses of Lost AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Bangle of Lost AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityArmor of Lost AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Chausses of Lost AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Greaves of Lost AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Bangle of Lost AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 3NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityWind-up GaiaMinionN/AABasic1Promises to Keep Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1DialogueAll boss and NPC lines are voice acted.Eden's Promise: Joined as one, never to be parted...
