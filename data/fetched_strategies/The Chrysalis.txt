If you alternate between the big and small orbs (big gives physical vulnerability, small gives magical vulnerability) then you won't take much damage. For each orb that hits him he will gain a stack. Small adds do not have much HP and perform a cone AoE. Stack up for heals andSacred Soilif you have 3+ stacks. 7 stacks is instant death for non tanks.Phase 2: 79% - 40%He will castDoubleand then castSparktwice, one tank canProvokewhile the other tank usesShirkon the first (atank swap) to help with this.At 40%, he will perform the orbs again, see phase 1.Phase 3: 39% - 20%He will castTripleand then castSparkthree times, again, tanks can tank swap to help with this.After second orb phase he will teleport around and castEnd of Days, a dodgeable straight line AoE, but the teleports are quite annoying. He will also randomly castQuake 3, which does AoE damage to party for about 2500 damage on non tanks.At 20%, he will perform MeteorFloor will turn red and give you aBleed. You can run to the edge and keep running while you are sucked in, after theBleedhits 0 you are instantly sucked in.After you are sucked in, you are sent to a new room.Any buffs/debuffs that were affecting you before you were sucked into the vortex will have their duration multiplied by 10. To make the next segment easier, all DPS should use all damage buffs, and Tanks should use defensive buffs andSprintright before entering the portal. Any regen effects should be cast on the two tanks as well.Meteors fall continuously.If a meteor doesn't land on a player, it deals high damage to the entire party, so one tank should take each meteor.Only tanks should try to get hit by meteors. Only one tank needs to be in any particular meteor's landing circle to prevent the splash damage. If non-tanks soak a meteor,they will likely die.One healer may wish to stay close to the center so they can DPS the tear, and heal the tanks taking the meteors.All DPS should group up just outside the first meteor. Once it lands a tear will appear on its location that must be killed to end the phase. 
DPS should immediately focus this tear, using aLimit Breakif available. There is a visual tell in the middle of the room, an extremely large meteor that slowly falls and will wipe the party if it manages to hit the ground before the tear is destroyed. Meteors will continue to fall and tanks should continue to run to the next empty meteor zone. Sprint for tanks should be held until after the first few meteors land. If there is difficulty overcoming this phase, DPS and tanks should be instructed before engaging that the limit-break should be held specifically for this phase.As long as all DPS is on the tear immediately after it spawns and Tanks focus on meteor interception this phase should go by relatively quickly and end upon the tear being destroyed.Phase 4: 19% - 0%Tank and Spank, in this phase he simply recycles mechanics from Phase 2.AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchSecret Ascian Man10DefeatNabrialesinthe Chrysalis.-2.5ImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
