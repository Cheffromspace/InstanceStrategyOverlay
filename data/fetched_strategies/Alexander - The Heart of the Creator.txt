There, you witness with your own eyes—and, in a shocking turn of events, help to bring about by your own hand—the tragedy that befell Mide and her companions that fateful day. Is time truly naught but a circle—the past, present, and future long since preordained—as the mad goblin prophet would have you believe? In the face of daunting odds, you press onward, that you might yet seize control of your own destiny.— In-game descriptionAlexander - The Heart of the Creatoris a level 60raidintroduced inpatch 3.4withHeavensward.

Move to the outer ring to avoid it, or take damage and get aVulnerability Updebuff.The third will have smaller light circles appear around the room in a clockwise manner until they connect, then one will appear in the middle. Wait in the middle until you have room to go in the outer ring where one already went off.Photon: 4 players will drop critically low. Just heal up.Propeller Wind:  Ensure you're behind one of the round objects or else you take damage and getConfused(it can be removed withEsuna).GA-100: Targets the OT, will hit for good damage against OT and AoE damage to rest of the party. Less party damage the further the AoE travels.Partway through the fight (around 50%), Cruise Chaser will teleport to the center, cast a knockback, become untargetable and transform into his flying form. YouMUSTclick on one of the four ducts around him or die. During the cutscene ensure you click the button next to the red progress bar before it runs out to avoid severe damage.Phase 2:Limit Cut: Cruise Chaser glows red and gains Immune.If you didn't do enough damage before the phase change, four Lapis Lazuli Orbs will spawn and Cruise Chaser will cast Limit Cut. Just dps the orbs.Eternal Darkness: Room-wide AoE damage (lots of AoE heals), and the room will now have a bleed. If any Lapis Lazuli Orbs are still alive when this goes off, you wipe.Optical Sight now has flying mech adds that are untargetable. These will shoot line AoEs when Cruise Chaser uses Optical Sight that will most likely result in death.Cruise Chaser will cast Limit Cut and spawn a Plasma Shield. You need to be in front of the shield to damage it.Cruise Chaser will rush the MT after the shield is destroyed or a certain amount of time passes.After the shield Cruise Chaser will cast Optical Sight, then mark a party member (usually dps) with Prey. Optical Sight and Prey will usually go off at the same time.Prey: Three large AoE attacks on the target. Healers need to heal through this and should throw on shields before.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Alexandrian LensOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian SpringOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Alexandrian ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian CrankOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian SpringOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian BoltOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Alexander III10Discover every location withinAlexander - the Heart of the Creator.-3.4EtymologyCruise Chaser is named afterCruise Chaser Blassty, a 1986 PC game developed by Squaresoft.
