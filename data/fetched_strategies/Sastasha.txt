For years, it was not known how the pirates were able to raid areas so far from the coast, until a local shepherd sighted a band of painted ruffians entering the Sastasha Seagrot, carrying large quantities of sacks and crates. Could it be that there is more to this cave than meets the eye?— In-game descriptionSastashais a level 15dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.

The note will have a special quote that will give the color of the correct switch for later.QuoteSwitchThe Capten likes his wine Redd.RedThe Capten likes his cabege Green.GreenThe Capten likes his sees Bloo.BlueThe party will soon encounter an open area containing severalGiant Clams, which can only be damaged when they are open. These enemies will be accompanied by several weakShade Seekers.Note that the clams do not need to be killed and can be ignored.Experienced parties will sometimes skip the clams for a faster run.To summon the first boss, players must interact with one of the three coral formations (Red, Blue, or Green) in the room. Interacting with the incorrect switch will spawn a weakCave Aurelia. In practice, many parties will ignore theBloody Memoand will brute force the switches until finding the correct one. Interacting with the correct switch will reveal anInconspicuous Switch. Pressing this switch will summon Chopper, the first boss. After defeating the boss, press the switch again to open a passage to the next section.Defeat the enemies and fightCaptain Madison, who will run away.The next section consists of an open area containing several side rooms.Most parties will skip these.Defeat the enemies at the south part of the room and collect theCaptain's Quarters Keyfrom theShallowscale Reaver. Use it to open the door to the Captain's Quarters, the southern room. Inside, defeat the loneShallowtail Reaverand collect theWaverider Gate Key.Return to the central room and go to the southwest exit. Defeat the two enemies and unlock the Waverider Gate.The rest of the dungeon is straightforward. The party will fight Captain Madison again, proceed through a final room of enemies, and confront the last boss. Not all enemies in the final room need to be aggroed, only the ones in the main path.Visiting the side rooms is required for theMapping the Realm: Sastashaachievement. Players who wish to obtain this achievement should useDuty Support, communicate with theirDuty Finderparty that they would like to visit the side rooms, or run the dungeon solo withUnrestricted Party(unsyncing) settings when they are of sufficiently high level.BossesSastasha Seagrot GuideChopperChopperis the first boss of Sastasha and it is acoeurl. Once in a whileChopperperforms an AoE attack called "Charged Whisker" which inflictsParalysison all players around it. An orange circle will appear on the ground before it executes the attack. Get out of the circle as soon as possible.Captain MadisonPlayers will need to defeat Captain Madison twice. In the first encounter, he will be accompanied by crew member adds. Kill them first and then focus on the boss until he runs away. In the second encounter, he will summon a pack of guard dogs once his HP has dropped to 50%. AoE the dogs down then attack the Captain until he flees.Denn the OrcatoothedDenn the Orcatoothed is the final boss of Sastasha. The boss room features 4 grates with bubbling water at each corner of the room. During the boss fight, adds will spawn from the bubbling water.Players can interact with the grate when it is bubbling to prevent an add from spawning. To this extent, ranged DPS can position themselves to be in range to attack, while still able to quickly interact with the grates when they bubble. Should adds spawn, try to keep their numbers down to prevent the tank from being overwhelmed. If a caster is targeted by the adds, they should run to the tank so that the tank can remove hate while staying by the boss.In practice, the grates and the adds they spawn are generally ignored, and all damage is focused on the boss.BestiaryNameDropsBaleen GuardBlack BatCaptain MadisonCave AureliaChopperDenn the OrcatoothedFossilshellNameDropsGiant ClamSastasha OrobonScurvy DogShade SeekerShallowclaw ReaverShalloweye ReaverShallowscale ReaverShallowtail ReaverLootSee also:Plundered Weapons,Plundered ArmorandPlundered AccessoriesChopperNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAcolyte's HalfglovesHands17BGreen1Aetherial Brass GorgetNecklace16DAetherial1Aetherial Brass WristletsBracelets16DAetherial1Foestriker's MittsHands17BGreen1Plundered Cavalier's HatHead17BGreen1Plundered CelataHead17BGreen1Plundered Ear CuffsEarrings17BGreen1Plundered EarringsEarrings17BGreen1Plundered GauntletsHands17BGreen1Plundered GogglesHead17BGreen1Captain MadisonNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAcolyte's RobeBody17BGreen1Acolyte's SkirtLegs17BGreen1Foestriker's SkirtLegs17BGreen1Foestriker's TabardBody17BGreen1Plundered CuirassBody17BGreen1Plundered TrousersLegs17BGreen1Denn the OrcatoothedFaded Copy of Riptide(Drops at a fixed rate)Sahagin Card(Drops at a fixed rate)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAcolyte's ThighbootsFeet17BGreen1Foestriker's BootsFeet17BGreen1From the Depths Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Gladiator's Plundered Arms (Lv. 15)OtherN/ABGreen1Plundered BattleaxeMarauder's Arm17BGreen1Plundered CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm17BGreen1Plundered GrimoireArcanist's Grimoire17BGreen1Plundered GuisarmeLancer's Arm17BGreen1Plundered KnivesRogue's Arm17BGreen1Plundered KnucklesPugilist's Arm17BGreen1Plundered SabatonsFeet17BGreen1Plundered ShortbowArcher's Arm17BGreen1Plundered StaffTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm17BGreen1Treasure CoffersTreasure Coffer 1 (X: 13.8 Y: 9.2)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPlundered SabatonsFeet17BGreen1Foestriker's BootsFeet17BGreen1Acolyte's ThighbootsFeet17BGreen1Seagrot WaterMaterialN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 11.2 Y: 14.7)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPlundered CelataHead17BGreen1Plundered GogglesHead17BGreen1Plundered Cavalier's HatHead17BGreen1Plundered GauntletsHands17BGreen1Foestriker's MittsHands17BGreen1Acolyte's HalfglovesHands17BGreen1Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 10.9 Y: 13.2)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPlundered CuirassBody17BGreen1Foestriker's TabardBody17BGreen1Acolyte's RobeBody17BGreen1Plundered TrousersLegs17BGreen1Foestriker's SkirtLegs17BGreen1Acolyte's SkirtLegs17BGreen1Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 7.9 Y: 13.7)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityGladiator's Plundered Arms (Lv. 15)OtherN/ABGreen1Plundered BattleaxeMarauder's Arm17BGreen1Plundered GuisarmeLancer's Arm17BGreen1Plundered KnucklesPugilist's Arm17BGreen1Plundered KnivesRogue's Arm17BGreen1Plundered ShortbowArcher's Arm17BGreen1Plundered StaffTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm17BGreen1Plundered GrimoireArcanist's Grimoire17BGreen1Plundered CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm17BGreen1Nightprowler's TargeShield17BGreen1Pirate's BandanaHead17BGreen1Plundered HaubergeonBody17BGreen1Plundered JacketBody17BGreen1Plundered BliaudBody17BGreen1Plundered MoccasinsFeet17BGreen1Plundered DuckbillsFeet17BGreen1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the following achievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Sastasha10Discover every location withinSastasha.-2.0ImagesLoreA Secret Port Of CallOn the coastline of western La Nosces, carved out of a rocky cliff by the sea’s ceaseless thrashing, there weaves a natural network of caverns called the Sastasha Seagrot. Meaning “many shells” in the Sahagin tongue, its name harks back to its former purpose as the beast tribe's gathering grounds.Rumor holds that, some fifty years past, the pirate king Mistbeard drove out the Sahagin inhabitants, whereupon he built docks for vessel repair and loading, quarters for his crew, and a tavern where they might rest after a hard day's plundering. This port thrived in secret until twenty-two years ago when Mistbeard abruptly vanished, leaving the facilities untended and in disrepair.At around the time of the Calamity, the Sahagin, desiring a foothold for their conquest of La Noscea, bade their minions reclaim the area. Known as the Serpent Reavers, these villainous pirates came to terrorize the region, vexing Lominsan authorities to no end and earning the Seagrot considerable notoriety.Denn the GreatoothedA renowned warrior of the Sahagin, his path is an allusion to the orca's viciousness and the tenacity with which it paces it prey. Favoring strategy over strength, his was the mind behind the utilization of men to achieve Sahagin ends.Return Of The ReaversThe dastardly Serpent Reavers were eventually vanquished at the hands of dauntless adventurers, after which the 4th Levy Yellowjackets were garrisoned in the Seagrot to maintain a security presence. Ere long, however, the soldiers found themselves overwhelmed by mysterious invaders whose appearance straddled that of man and monster.So it was that adventurers again ventured into the caverns to deal with these abominations, who were discovered to be none other than members of the Serpent Reavers. Examining their remains, the aetherial researcher Ceana posited that the pirates' monstrous forms were the result of repeated exposure to their master Leviathan’s corrupting aether—a theory which has gone on to gain traction in academia.Captain MadisonFormerly the navigator aboard a merchant vessel, Madison orchestrated his own disappearance some ten years ago in order to escape a prodigious gambling debt. Of his trail he left no trace until he reemerged as a member of the newly formed Serpent Reavers. Thriving, in the pirating trade, he swiftly climbed to the post of captain, but his failure to defend the Sastasha Seagrot earned him the ire of his Sahagin masters. For his punishment, he was given to Leviathan once more and transformed into a hideous fiend.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
