His rendition of your triumph over the Ultima Weapon takes the threads of history and weaves them into an epic tapestry. However, his ballad contains so many embellishments and fabrications that it bears little resemblance to your own tale, and you wonder if he was even listening to you.

Throughout this fight, the arena will be surrounded by a wall that will cause instant death if touched. Players can be revived after a short while.
Finally, it is important to note that this fight has multiple strategies and different methods that can be employed. Therefore, it is recommended that parties learn what works best for their individual party and use this as a base line to start with.For each phase, the bosses will perform mechanics that can be handled with a specific method. When these mechanics are resolved this way, the boss will receive a stack of theAetherically Chargedbuff. Once the boss reaches 4 stacks of this buff, they will begin to glow and receive the buffAwakened, which gives them new abilities and changes mechanics of existing abilities. If a boss is defeated in this state, a pillar of light will appear on the ground. If a player passes through this, they receive the buffBeyond Limitswhich will refill the Limit Gauge when the buffed player uses a level 3 Limit Break. This is required to progress through the fight.Phase 1:GarudaAbilitiesDown Burst: Heavy-hitting frontal cleave tankbuster with no cast bar. If the boss is buffed withAwakened, the attack hits both tanks and can be split with the entire party.Aerial Blast: Heavy-hitting raid wide damage. Mitigate and heal through.Mistral Shriek: Raid-wide damage. Mitigate and shield through.Mistral Song: A healer receives a green marker over their head. The boss will turn towards the marked healer and fire a line AoE in their direction, dealing heavy damage. A tank must mitigate by breaking the Line of Sight of the attack. The first player hit by this attack will have a large wind AoE spawn underneath them.Slipstream: A large frontal cleave that deals heavy damage and debuffs anyone hit by it withStun. This attack is only telegraphed by its cast bar and can be avoided by not standing in front of the boss.Feather Rain: The boss will disappear and spawn several small AoEs under players. If players are hit by these, they take massive damage and receive a Damage over TimeWindburndebuff, which also deals heavy damage per tick.Eye of the Storm: The edge of the arena will be marked by a purple AoE and be covered by a cyclone. Touching this will result in immediate death. This effectively shrinks the arena down even smaller, so players need to be careful when maneuvering around.Friction: The boss will turn to a random player and mark them with an AoE that deals splash damage. Any player hit by this attack receives a stack of the debuffThermal Low.Mesohigh: The ads tether to a random player, deals damage and dispels any stacks ofThermal Lowthey may have, damaging the party. If the player has no stacks ofThermal Low, the attack will kill them.Wicked Wheel: Point-blank AoE that will instantly kill anyone hit.Wicked Tornado: When the boss becomesAwakened, the party is hit by an instant-kill raid-wide AoE that can only be avoided directly in the boss's hitbox or far opposite of it.Strategybefore the boss is pulled, assign 3 DPS to receive 2 stacks ofThermal Lowlater in the fight.
The main tank should pull the boss close to the northern edge of the arena and faced away from the party. The boss will then castSlipstream, and a healer will be marked forMistral Songand should move away from the party and towards the main tank. The main tank should then move in between the healer and Garuda. After the attack, the boss will perform anotherSlipstream, then aDownburston the main tank, and spawn 4Satin Plumesand 1Spiny Plume. TheSatin Plumeswill tether to 1 DPS each, and theSpiny Plumewill tether to whoever attacks it first. If the plumes are left alone, they will inflictSleepon all players, so they should be AoE burned down quickly. A tank should grab theSpiny Plume, as it hits withCyclone, dealing heavy magic-based damage, and also debuffs with a stackingThermal Low. The boss will also castFeather Rainhere, which players will need to avoid., then follow up with aMistral Shriek.Thermal Lowis a debuff that deals raid-wide damage when the debuff is removed. If a player receives three stacks, the party will be wiped when the debuff is removed. The debuff can be removed either by stepping into the bubble left behind by theSpiny Plume'sattackGigastormwhen it is defeated, or by a tether from the boss calledMesohigh. This debuff persists through death.
The tank should be sure to take no more than 2 hits ofCyclone. When they debuff 2 stacks, the boss will receive a stack ofAetherically Charged. 
The boss will then castFrictiontwice in a row on two random players which will deal splash damage and inflictThermal Low.To handle this part of the phase correctly, it is recommended that the tank holding theSpiny Plumeonly take two stacks, then defeat the ad. After the boss castsMistral Shriek, the healers should top everyone off, then the tank can cleanse their debuffs in the large bubble left behind by the ad. Garuda will receive 1 stack ofAetherically Charged. Once the boss casts the firstFriction, have all players stack inside the bubble, except for the three pre-assigned DPS, which will stand outside. This will give those DPS their first stack ofThermal Low. For the second cast, all players should move outside the bubble, giving all players at least 1 stack, while the pre-assigned DPS will have 2. After this, two of the DPS with 2 stacks should cleanse their debuff in the bubble one at a time, giving healers the time to top everyone off between each cleanse. After this, the boss will have 3 stacks ofAetherically Charged, 5 players will have 1 stack, and 1 player will have 2 stacks.After this, the boss will castEye of the Storm, then summonChiradaandSuparna. These ads will have the same skills as the boss. Immediately after summoning the ads, they will cast anotherFeather Rainand mark a DPS and healer withMistral Songand jump to two of the four cardinals. While this is happening, the boss will castWicked Wheel. Pull the boss to the edge of the arena so players can simply avoid the attack. The tanks will then move in front of the ads at the edge of the arena and intercept theMistral Songswhile the rest of the players stack in the center. Tornadoes will appear under the tanks where the attacks hit.
Once the tornadoes drop, pull the boss back to the center of the room, as she will follow up with anotherEye of the Storm, and summon 4 more Satin Plumes. Pull them together and burn them down quickly. The ads outside the arena will move to the east and west and tether to players withMesohigh. Have the player with 2 stacks ofThermal Lowand one other player with a stack intercept the tethers. The main tank should turn the boss away, as it is about to castDownburst. AfterMesohighresolves, the boss will receive its final stack ofAetherically Chargedand receive the buffAwakened.The ads will cast anotherFeather Rain, and Garuda will castSlipstream, then follow up withWicked WheelandWicked Tornado. To handle this, players need to move out of melee range, then back into the boss's hitbox. The boss will useDownburstwhich now needs to be split between at least two tanks. AnotherSlipstreamwill come out, then the boss will enrage, and castAerial Blast, wiping the party.
If the boss is defeated before this, A pillar of light will appear. A melee, caster or healer need to pick this up and receive the buffBeyond Limits. The tanks and healers should also have a stack ofThermal Loweach.Phase 2:IfritAbilitiesCrimson Cyclone: The boss will jump to the outside of the arena, charge up, then dash across the arena. Any player hit by this will die. If the boss has theAwakenedbuff, the boss will leave a lingering cross-shaped burn on the stage which will kill those who touch it.Hellfire: deals massive raid-wide damage. Needs to be mitigated and healed through.Radiant Plume. Large AoEs will appear on the arena and explode into large fire pillars after 4 seconds. These can appear in different patterns. Players hit by these will die.Vulkan Burst: A large AoE under the boss that deals minimal damage but has a large knockback. If this attack is shielded, it will deal no damage and no knockback.Inferno Howl: The boss will target a healer withSearing Wind, a debuff that will explode in a fire pillar periodically during its duration. Players who die with this debuff will still explode. When the boss receives theAwakenedbuff,Searing Windlasts for 30 seconds.Incinerate: Heavy-hitting tankbuster that deals fire-based damage and debuffs withFire Resistance Down.Infernal Fetters: A DPS and the 2nd player in the enmity list will be tethered together and debuffed withInfernal Fetters. This debuff reduces damage dealt by these players and deals damage to them. If these players move away from each other, they will receive more stacks, which will further debuff their damage output and deal more damage to them subsequently.Eruption: AoEs will appear under players and explode after 2.5 seconds, dealing fatal damage.Flaming Crush: A random DPS will be marked with a red arrow. The boss will then fire an attack at them that must be split with the party. If the boss isAwakened, the attack inflictsAccursed Flame, which debuffs anyone hit with a heavy DoT that deals massive damage. The more players that split this attack however, the less time the DoT lasts.StrategyOnce Garuda is defeated,Ifritwill appear at a random cardinal and begin castingCrimson Cycloneand cover the arena inRadiant Plumes. The only safe areas will be the cardinals adjacent to the boss. Players should move to these safe areas immediately when the boss spawns. After this resolves, the boss will return to the center of the arena and castHellfireandVulcan Burst. Healers will need to shield this to make sure no one is knocked into the wall. From here, the boss will need to be picked up by the main tank, as it doesn't share enmity with the previous boss.Ifritwill castIncineratethree times. The main tank can either take all three with an invulnerability skill, or tanks can swap for each attack. The boss will then summon fourInfernal Nails.The nails will always spawn in a random location; however they will spawn in similar groupings: two nails will spawn close to each other, and two will spawn far away from one another. When the nails are destroyed, they deal raid-wide damage and debuff withVulnerability Up. This debuff only lasts 1 second, but stacks. This prevents multiple nails being destroyed at the same time.
The boss will target a healer at this time withInfernal Howl. The targeted healer should move to the edge of the arena and drop this attack. The boss will then castInfernal Tethers, chaining players together. Finally, the boss will begin castingEruption. Players need to make sure each nail is hit byEruptiontwice, as this will cause the nails to receiveVulnerability DownandDamage Upbuffs, but when they are destroyed, they will give the boss a stack ofAetherically Charged, buffing the boss withAwakening. The order the nails are destroyed in will determine where the boss will fireCrimson Cyclonefrom.
After all the nails are defeated, the boss will move to the center of the arena and use anotherHellfire, thenInfernal Howlon a healer, followed byEruption. Since the boss will have theAwakenedbuff, theSearing Winddebuff will last 30 seconds.AfterEruption,Ifrit Cloneswill spawn at the edges of the arena at the cardinals and useCrimson Cyclone.These mechanics will fire in rapid succession, so to handle this, the main tank should pull the boss to the southwest edge immediately afterHellfire. Two players should move away along the wall on the northeast side of the arena to bait outEruptions, then move towards the party. Finally, the healer withSearing Windshould move to the opposite side of the arena to the party. This will ensure all players avoid theCrimson Cyclonesand theEruptions.Once these mechanics have resolved, the boss will castInfernal Howlagain. Both healers will haveSearing Windfor a short time here, so players need to be careful moving around them. After this,Ifritwill mark a DPS withFlaming Crush. Everyone other than the healers need to stack with this DPS to mitigate damage and the amount of time theAccursed Flamedebuff lasts.Ifrit will leap to the edge of the arena and summon three more clones, chargingCrimson Cycloneagain. The clones will drop in line with where the nails had spawned. From here, the clones will charge in the order which the nails were killed. Players other than theSearing Winddebuffed healer should move to where the fourth nail was defeated, with the healer moving to the opposite side, and move around the arena to where each nail was defeated, dodging theCrimson Cyclones. when the boss charges across the arena, since it is awakened, it will leave behind a large cross of fire on the arena. If the boss starts at an intercardinal, it will charge and the cross will form at the cardinals, and vice versa. Players need to identify where the boss starts and end up in the safe zone based on this.The boss will return to the center of the room and castIncineratethree more times. The boss will follow up withEruptionon the two furthest players, anotherFlaming Crushwhich can be mitigated with all players, then the boss will enrage, castingHellfire.Once the boss is defeated, it will drop another pillar of light, which needs to be grabbed by a caster, healer or melee DPS player. Players need to wait untilTitanspawns to pick this up however, as the boss spawns and immediately performs a knockback attack, sending anyone not at the edge of the arena into the wall.Phase 3:TitanAbilitiesGeocrush: The boss will face a cardinal direction and leap to the edge in that direction, dealing heavy proximity-based damage. This attack also shrinks the size of the arena, so players need to be careful.Rock Buster: A heavy-hitting frontal cleave tankbuster. This attack has no cast time. The boss performs this and follows up withMountain Buster.Mountain Buster: A second frontal cleave tankbuster that deals heavy damage. This attack has no cast time.Upheaval: A knockback attack.Earthen Fury: Raid-wide damage. Mitigate and heal through.Weight of the Land: Random players will be marked by AoEs underneath them which explode shortly afterwards. If the boss is buffed withAwakened, the AoEs will appear three times in a row.Landslide: The boss will fire five line AoEs from its hitbox. Getting hit by this attack will throw players into the wall and kill them. If the boss has theAwakenedbuff, the boss will fire another set of line AoEs in between the spaces of the first set.Rock Throw: Rocks will drop from the ceiling. If they land on a player, they will die fromBury. Once the rocks land, they will begin castingBurstand explode in small AoEs around them.Granite Gaol: A random player is marked with a small marker underneath them. Afterwards, the player will be debuffed withFetters, rendering them immobile, then they will be trapped inside aGranite Gaol. The Gaol will begin castingGranite Sepulchre, which will wipe the raid if it finishes casting. The Gaol must be destroyed before this cast goes off by either player DPS or viaBurstfrom a rock. If destroyed this way, the Gaol will drop a puddle, killing anyone who steps into it. IfTitansteps into one of these puddles, it will gain a stack ofAetherically Charged.Tumult: Deals raid-wide damage. This is cast multiple times in a row.StrategyImmediately afterIfritis defeated,Titanwill spawn in the center of the arena and immediately useGeocrush, dealing most likely fatal damage to anyone who isn't close to the wall. After this attack resolves, a player can collect the light pillar. The boss will follow up withEarthen Fury, which needs to be mitigated and healed through. Have the main tank grab enmity from the boss and prepare for theRock/Mountain Bustercombo. The boss will follow this up withWeight of the Land, which players will need to dodge out of.Titanwill then useGeocrush, turning and facing a cardinal direction then leaping to it. Players need to identify which way the boss is jumping and move away to the other side.OnceTitanlands, it will begin to castUpheavalandRock Throw. The rocks will drop opposite the boss, and players need to get knocked back into the safe zone behind the rocks. If players get hit by the rocks or are knocked back too far, they will die. To handle this combo, players need to stand within the boss's hitbox and determine where the rocks will drop, then stand to either the left or right of the arrow on the front of the boss's hitbox. When it castsUpheaval, it will knock players into the safe zone behind the rocks. The rocks will also castBurst, so players need to be careful and stay stacked. After this, another rock will drop in the previous safe zone, and the boss will mark players forGranite Gaols.After players are marked withGranite Gaol, the boss will begin castingLandslide. It will use this attack twice. Players marked for Gaols will need to create a line between the last rock castingBurstand the boss. This way, when the rock explodes, it frees the player closest to it and drops a puddle, creating a chain reaction, freeing players and creating puddles across the arena that lead to the boss. This will give the boss its first stack ofAetherically Chargedand continue to do so while the boss stands in place castingTumult. Players marked with Gaols will have to dodge the firstLandslidebut can position themselves and not worry about the second.After these resolve,Titanwill castTumulteight times. Players should group up for AoE healing to make things easier. Following this, the boss will castWeight of the land, so move out of the AoEs. By the time this resolves, the boss will have gained enough stacks ofAetherically Chargedto receive the buffAwakened. The boss will castLandslide, which will be theAwakenedversion, so a second wave ofLandslideswill fire after the first set, in the areas that were previously a safe zone. Titan will then face a cardinal and useGeocrush, so move to the opposite side it is facing. Once it lands it will castGranite Gaolon one of the healers. This needs to be destroyed immediately, then players need to move out of anotherLandslideset. The boss will then go into castingTumult6 times in a row. Immediately after, the boss will use itsRock/Mountain Bustercombo and drop more rocks in the center of the arena. These rocks will drop clockwise around the center one by one.The boss will useWeight of the Landthree times and anotherAwakened Landslide. During this players will need to be careful as the rocks will still be dropping in the center.Finally, the boss will use anotherRock/Mountain Bustercombo and another set ofWeight of the Lands. It will useTumult8 times in a row, then enrage and begin castingEarthen Fury, which will wipe the party.After the boss is defeated, it will drop the final pillar of light. By this point a melee DPS, a caster and a healer should each have theBeyond Limitsbuff, as several level 3 Limit Breaks are required for the next phase.Phase 4:LahabreaStrategyThe boss will begin with four large pillars dropping at the cardinals of the arena and dealing proximity damage. Players should stack in the center to shield and heal through this. The boss will summon 6Magitek Bitsaround the arena. They will begin slow-castingSelf Destructwhich will wipe the party. These can only be defeated in time by using the level three caster Limit Break. This should only be used by the caster with theBeyond Limitsbuff. After using this, the Limit Gauge will refill.  Players should also be attacking the bits to ensure the Limit Break kills them all. After they are destroyed,Lahabreawill spawn and immediately castBlight, which will reduce all players HP to 1, inflictDoomwhich lasts for 8 seconds, andDown for the Count, which lasts for 4 seconds. The only way to survive this is by using the healer level 3 Limit Break. Again, make sure the healer withBeyond Limitsuses the Limit Break. The boss will become targetable and begin castingDark IV, which will hit for max damage. Use the level 3 melee Limit Break to defeat him while other players attack the boss to ensure it dies. AfterLahabreais defeated,The Ultima Weaponwill spawn and castUltima, an attack that must be mitigated via shields, cooldowns, and a level 3 tank Limit Break.Phase 5:The Ultima WeaponAbilitiesThe boss is able to call on allAwakenedversions of prior bosses’ abilities, and also has its own:Ultima: Lethal raid-wide attack that must be mitigated with a level 3 Limit Break from a tank and several cooldowns and shields.Ultima Aether: A gauge for the boss that will gradually increase. If this gauge reaches 100%, the boss will begin its enrage sequence. Each player death during this phase will also increase the gauge by 4%.Homing Lasers: Heavy-hitting tankbuster targeting the 2nd player in the enmity list, hitting with a small AoE underneath them. Needs to be mitigated.Aetheric Boom: A knockback from the boss's hitbox.Tank Purge: Hard-hitting raid-wide damage. Mitigate and heal through.Ceruleum Vent: A large AoE that fires in front of the boss.Diffractive Laser: A frontal cleaving tankbuster with no cast time.Viscous Aetheroplasm: A frontal cleave that debuffs players withViscous Aetheroplasm, which explodes and must be mitigated by the party.StrategyImmediately after castingUltima, the boss will consume the other Primals, then castTank Purgefollowed byHoming Lasers. The boss will then castUltimate Predation.Garudawill appear randomly around the center of the arena, whileIfritandUltima Weaponwill appear at one of the intercardinals.Titanwill spawn at a cardinal.Garudawill start by castingWicked WheelandWicked Tornado.Ifritwill use theAwakenedversion ofCrimson Cyclone, which will leave behind the cross-shaped puddle through the cardinals.Titanwill use theAwakenedversion ofLandslide, meaning players will have to dodge out of an attack, then back into where it was to avoid the second hit.Ultima Weaponwill follow up withCeruleum Vent, rendering the entire area unsafe in front of it. Finally,Garudawill useFeather Rainto close out the mini-phase. There are several methods to dodging these mechanics, however players should be aware of whereUltima Weaponis and whereIfrit'sattack will drop the cross-shaped puddle. Players should avoid standing in front ofUltimaand dodge carefully between theTitan Landslides.After all these attacks resolve, the boss will appear in the center of the arena and summon all three Primals. Each one will prepare to fire their own unique mechanics:Ifritwill castEruption.Ultima Weaponwill castRadiant Plumeat the edges of the arena.Titanwill cast Rocks on the arena, which drop moving clockwise around the arena.TitanandUltima Weaponwill both fireLandslide.Titanwill use theAwakenedversion of this attack.Titanwill useTumult, andUltima Weaponwill castViscous Aetheroplasmon its main target.ChiradaandSuparnawill spawn at the east and west and castWicked Wheel, so move away from them.Garudawill spawn in the center and useMistral Shriekwile the ads move and useFeather Rain.Ultima Weaponwill castHoming Laserson the player that is 2nd in the enmity list.Garudawill finish the mini-phase by castingFeather Rain.A common strategy to handle this phase is to simply moveUltima Weaponto the south. This will causeTitanto move to the north, and many of the mechanics will resolve around the party with minimal dodging. Players should move out from the front of the boss to avoidViscous Aetheroplasm.After all attacks have resolved, the boss will enter its next mini-phase. The boss will move to the north of the arena, whileGarudaspawns in the south, withTitanandIfritin the southeast and southwest.Titanwill castWeight of the LandandIfritwill cast theAwakenedversion ofFlaming Crushon a random player. that isn't one of the tanks, andGarudawill castEye of the Storm, so players need to be careful near the edge of the arena.Weight of the Landwill fire again, andGarudawill tether a player withMesohigh. A player with aThermal Lowdebuff will take the tether.A thirdWeight of the Landwill fire, and anAetheroplasmorb will spawn.One of the healers will be debuffed withSearing WindandGarudawill useFeather Rain. A secondAetheroplasmorb will spawn.Titanwill use theAwakenedversion ofLandslide, whileIfrituses theAwakenedversion ofCrimson Cyclone.The second wave ofLandslidewill fire, and the cross puddle fromIfritwill appear. The thirdAetheroplasmorb will spawn.Garudawill useEye of the Stormand tether another random player withMesohigh. Another player with theThermal Lowdebuff will take the tether.Ultima Weaponwill begin castingTank Purgeand spawn a fourth orb.Garuda will castFeather Rainand the boss will finish castingTank Purge.This mini-phase, the boss will be targetable for the entire phase. While handling other mechanics, players will mainly need to handle theAetheroplasmorbs that spawn. These directly affect the orbs that spawn in a later mini-phase. When a player steps into the orb’s hitbox, they will take some damage and tether to the boss. It is recommended that three players each step into the first two orbs, then the tanks each take one of the two remaining orbs. This will give players ample time in a later phase to handle the orbs later on.For the rest of the mechanics in this fight, a common strategy is to keep players stacked close together to baitWeight of the Landand stay stacked forFlaming Crushto mitigate the damage and length of the debuff. It also keeps players close to make grabbing theMesohightether and avoidingFeather Raineasier. Players will need to soak the orbs and stack to mitigate and AoE heal throughTank Purge.AfterTank Purge,Ultima Weaponwill warp to the center of the arena. The healer withSearing Windshould move to the south, away from the party to avoid overlapping and dealing unnecessary damage. The boss will castEye of the Stormand follow up withHoming Lasers, targeting the second player in the enmity list (usually the off tank). This player needs to separate slightly from the rest of the party to avoid the small AoE from the attack.The boss will cast anotherEye of the Stormand follow that up withRadiant PlumesandDiffractive Laser. After this, healers should get ready to use shields to mitigate theVulcan Burstthat follows. The boss will cast anotherEye of the Stormand repeat the attacks withHoming Lasersand anotherVulkan Burst/Eye of the Stormcombo and anotherDiffractive Laser.When the boss reaches 49.9% HP, it will castUltimate Suppression. Players should try to push the boss to this phase after the firstHoming Lasersto deal damage before the boss becomes intangible.In this mini-phase,Ultima Weaponwill spawn in the northeast,Titanin the southeast,Garudain the northwest, andIfritin the southeast.ChiradaandSuparnawill spawn near the center of the arena at the northwest and southeast.Featherlanceswill begin rotating around the arena.Eruptionwill cast three times on random players.The secondEruptionwill be joined by players getting marked forMistral Song.The thirdEruptionwill be joined by a player not targeted by the other attacks being marked forGranite Gaol.With the fourthEruption,Mistral Songswill also resolve and the Gaol marked player will become trapped.Garudawill use an AoE on a random target.The ads will castFeather Rainand the Gaol will begin castingGranite Impact.Garudawill cast anotherFeather Rain' and a light pillar will appear and begin moving towards a random player who is untargeted by other attacks.Ultima Weaponwill fireAetherochemical Laserthrough the center of the arena and through the intercardinals of its hitbox.Garudawill tether another player withMesohighandTitanwill castLandslidewhileIfritmarks a DPS withFlaming Crush.The secondLandslideandFlaming Crushwill fire andMesohighwill resolve.Garuda will castFeather Rain, andUltima Weaponwill fireTank Purge.These mechanics will come out quite quickly, and there are several ways to handle them. However, a common strategy is to stack loosely nearGarudaand separate from theEruptiontarget. Move towards the center to bait the secondEruption. Tanks should intercept theMistral Songswhile the rest of the party moves towards the south to bait the thirdEruption. The Gaol-marked player will be able to stand in the fourthEruptionwithout worrying about taking damage. The light pillar will appear and begin following the player not targeted by any of these other attacks. From here it is simply about dodging attacks and releasing the Gaoled player as soon as possible.From here, move together as a group to baitLandslideswhile the tether forMesohighand theFlame Crushmarker come out. The player withThermal Lowwill take the tether as players dodge out ofLandslidesand avoidFeather Rain. Finally, players should prepare forTank Purgeby mitigating and shielding. The boss will return to the middle and become targetable.Ultima Weaponwill castUltima. This needs to be mitigated heavily and requires another tank Limit Break level 3. The boss will follow up withAetheric Boom. This will knockback all players and spawn four sets of orbs. Players can prevent the knockback by popping their knockback immunity skills. The orbs will spawn and the tether between them is based on how the orbs from the previous phase were handled. Players need to run into the orbs and soak them, causing them to drop small AoE puddles underneath them. Having a tank take four of the orbs and the rest of the party handle the other sets of orbs is a common strategy, as long as the tank has enough cooldowns to help mitigate the damage.Once the orbs have been handled, the Primals will spawn in a random order around the boss.Ultima Weaponwill useViscous Aetheroplasm, debuffing random players. The Primals will cycle through their attacks in a set order:Garudawill useWicked Wheel/Tornado, thenAerial Blast, and aFeather Rain.Ifritwill cast anEruptionthat will fire twice. It will then useCrimson Cyclonefiring from the cardinals.Ifritwill then follow up withHellfire.Titanwill fire threeWeight of the Landand follow that up withEarthen Fury.During each Primal set of attacks, one of theViscous Aetheroplasmswill explode. It is recommended to use damage dealing Limit Breaks duringIfritorGaruda, as players will be moving too much to execute a Limit Break.Once the Primals finish their attacks,Ultima Weaponwill move to the north of the arena and begin charging its gauge to 100%. Once it reaches 100%, the boss will begin the enrage sequence. Each player, ordered by increasing damage done to the boss, will become fettered and and lifted in the air, after which the boss will instantly kill them withCitadel Siege. Players who are killed are unable to be resurrected. The final player will be killed with a lengthy animation ofSabikafter they are fettered.
