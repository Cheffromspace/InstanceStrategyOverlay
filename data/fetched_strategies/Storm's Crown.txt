After they resolve, a lock of hair will tether to each player, pulling them within the boundary of the AoE and debuffing them withTangled.

This attack also spawns asBrutal Gustas well.StrategyPhase 1The boss begins the battle with aVoid Aero IV, damaging the entire party. She then returns to the center of the arena and castsSavage Barbery, placing either a line AoE or donut AoE, in accordance with which direction the red blades appear. She will then throw her sword to the spot indicated by the large red arrow. Following this, she will tether to the blade and performHair Raid, turning towards the center of the arena and firing a wide conal AoE. Players must move behind the blade to avoid damage. She will then castVoid Aero III, so both tanks must use mitigation and stand together to take the attack. After a few auto attacks, she will return to the center of the arena and perform the oppositeSavage Barberythan the one she performed first, following up withHair Raidonce again. This is followed up by anotherVoid Aero IV.Following this, the boss will return to the center of the arena and castTeasing Tangles, spawning four large AoEs at the cardinals of the arena. Once these resolve, two players each will tether to the hair in the center of each AoE and be pulled into them and inflicted withTangled, a debuff that slows character movement. If players move beyond the boundary of their tether, they are pulled back in and dealt damage, as well as theSustaining Damagedebuff. While players are tethered, the boss will castSecret Breeze, firing two sets of several conal AoEs. Players must stand in the spaces between the first set, then move to where the first set previously was to avoid taking damage from the second set. After this, players will be set free.The boss will then drop a stacking marker on a random player, requiring everyone to stack to mitigate the damage. From here the phase will repeat until players bring the boss to below 70% health, with the only added difference being that duringHair Raid, four players will be marked with AoEs that they must spread out to avoid overlapping other players. After this, the boss will return to the center and castCurling Iron, eventually knocking all players back and stunning them. A short cinematic will play, indicating the start of phase two.Phase 2Attacks will come quickly in this phase. Players must always be ready to move, as several AoEs will quickly appear and overlap.The boss will return to the arena and deal high damage withCatabasis, so healers should be ready. The boss will return to center and begin firing line AoEs, while also forming an AoE in the center with six curved lines reaching the edge of the arena. Players need to avoid the firing of the straight line AoEs, then stand in the safe zones to avoid damage. Following this, several clones will appear at the edge of the arena and charge in straight lines across the arena twice in quick succession. Players will have to quickly move into the safe zones between charges. The boss will perform another AoE with curved lines similar to before, then mark a player with a stack marker as well as a large rock AoE marker. All players will need to stack to mitigateDeadly Twist, then move out of the large AoE to avoidBoulder.Immediately after the stack marker resolves, the boss will target both tanks with a high damage AoE tankbuster. Both tanks must separate and use mitigation to survive the attacks. Any other player hit by these will die. The boss will then useKnuckle Drum, striking the ground several times dealing increasingly higher damage to the party. Following this, the boss will mark another player to stack while a random tank will receive another marker. Both attacks will resolve at the same time so the tank must move away from the party. The tank will take high damage fromBoulder Break, which will result in light damage for the rest of the party. While this is happening, the boss will useTouslein the center of the arena, summoning several small AoEs that move outwards to the edge of the arena. Touching one of these will knock the player into the air, deal high damage and debuff with a stackingVulnerability Up. This is a high amount of damage coming in, so healers should be prepared.After the stack marker resolves, the boss will return to center and castTornado Chain, dropping two AoEs, a large one at the center of the arena, and a donut AoE with the safe zone meeting the edge of the first AoE. Players must stand at the outside of the arena, then move in after the first AoE fires to avoid damage. At the same time, players will need to be spread out to handle theHair SprayAoE around them. After this, the boss will useKnuckle Drumin the center of the arena. By the end of this attack, all of theTousleAoEs will have fired and reached the edge of the arena. The boss will return to the center of the arena again and summon clones to charge to the edge of the arena in a line AoE and finish up withBlow Away, calling several wide AoEs that spawn randomly around the arena. Players need to pay attention to avoid taking high damage and multiple stacks ofVulnerability Up.Just asBlow Awayis ending, the boss will useTeasing Tanglesagain, tethering players to AoEs. The boss will useTornado Chargeagain, while also placing a knockback marker. Players must move to the edge of their AoE without leaving it to ensure they are not knocked back into the edge of the arena. The tethers will break after this and the boss will useBoulder Breakon the tanks again, requiring them to separate from the group. After this, anotherKnuckle Drum. The boss will fire several line AoEs, then castTeasing Tanglesonce more. This time, the boss will castTousle, requiring players to dodge carefully. At the same time, the boss will useTornado Chainagain. The best way to handle this is to move to the inner edge of the AoE to quickly move into the safe zone, as movement is restricted and the AoE fires rather quickly. The tethers will break once again and the boss will performKnuckle Drumin the center of the arena once more.At this point, the phase will repeat until the boss is defeated, starting again with the boss firing several line AoEs.Loot12Allagan Tomestone of Causality6Allagan Tomestone of ComedyBarbariccia Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)DialogueBarbariccia: Such rich, exquisite aether...
