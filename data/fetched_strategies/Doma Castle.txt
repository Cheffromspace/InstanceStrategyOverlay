And thus did Lord Hien declare that Doma Castle should be flooded, to eliminate the greater portion of the imperial garrison and trap Yotsuyu within the keep. Your allies have set the stage, and now you must play your part─as well as the wandering adventurers whom you have recruited to fight for Doma's liberation. The fate of a nation shall be decided this day─marshal your forces and venture unto the flooded fortress!— In-game descriptionDoma Castleis a level 67dungeonintroduced inpatch 4.0withStormblood.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Magitek Rearguard3.2Magitek Hexadrone3.3Hypertuned Grynewaht4Loot4.1Magitek Rearguard4.2Magitek Hexadrone4.3Hypertuned Grynewaht4.4Additional Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 11.4 Y: 13.9)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 9.1 Y: 14.1)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 7.1 Y: 10.3)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 6.3 Y: 8.7)4.4.4.1Miss List5Achievements6Images7Lore7.1The Castle on the One River7.2Magitek Hexadrone7.3Hypertuned Grynewaht7.4MoreDuty SupportGosetsuDoman ShamanYugiriDoman LiberatorClassSamuraiShamanNinjaSamuraiRoleTankHealerDPSDPSObjectivesArrive at the Third Armory: 0/1Defeat themagitek rearguard: 0/1Arrive at the Training Grounds: 0/1Defeat themagitek hexadrone: 0/1Arrive at the Hall of the Scarlet Swallow: 0/1DefeatHypertuned Grynewaht: 0/1BossesDoma Castle GuideMagitek RearguardCermet Pile- Tankbuster. Avoid facing towards the group as it cleaves.Garlean Fire- Quite similar to the earlier Gunship's AoE, but fires a line of circles. Just dodge to the side of the circle instead of in front of it. There's a big arrow indicator on it to help show where it will go. As the fight goes on he'll begin using two lines side by side.Rearguard Bit- These will be lined up on the edge of the arena firing an unnamed attack for major damage. It's a narrow line across the arena, but occasionally ones next to each other will fire together for a wider beam.Rearguard Mine- Small orange bots will float across the arena, contact will cause them to explode for major damage.Magitek HexadroneCircle of Death- Large AoE centered on the boss.2-tonze Magitek Missile - Obvious stack mechanic.Chain Mine - A Hexadrone Bit will appear on the edge of the arena and erect a damaging red field across the arena, restricting the area you can safely move in. Standing within will cause it to deal damage and knockback.Magitek Missiles - A tower will appear; at least one player needs to stand in it to prevent moderate damage hitting the entire group.Hypertuned GrynewahtChainsaw - The boss will charge up his chainsaw and use it in front of him, dealing continuous damage in that direction. Players in front of him can simply sidestep this as he won't move after it starts.Delay-action Charge - Two large AoE markers will track a pair of players. Simply move away from other players to avoid harming them when it goes off. Later on in the fight it will target three players at once.Gunsaw - One random player will be targeted by this and continually fired upon. Unlike Chainsaw it will continue to track so there's no avoiding it, but it pierces and will hit anyone in front of or behind you so avoid moving it over your party members.Thermobaric Charge - One player will be marked with a proximity marker that tracks the player. After a few seconds the rings around the player will disappear and the proximity marker will remain there. Whoever's marked should move away from the party to drop it off before rejoining the party.Clean Cut - Magitek Chakrams will appear around the edge of the arena, and use this to slice across the arena. Pay attention to where the chakram appear for some forewarning about where to dodge.Chain Mine - Just like Magitek Hexadrone, except the bits are Hypertuned Bits. This will split the arena into four quadrants, usually used alongside Thermobaric Charge to restrict how far you can drop it if you're not prepared for it.LootSee also:Yanxian Weapons,Yanxian

Castle.-4.0ImagesLoreThe Castle on the One RiverDoma Castle is the seat of power of the nation of Doma, whose dominion encompasses the region of Yanxia. Positioned to control the One River, an artery of trade and transportation, it exploits the cascading waters of the Dragon’s Struggle as a natural defense. Ordinarily, its proximity to the river would render it vulnerable to erosion and flooding, but the site had been subjected to a thorough survey by geomancers to ensure the stability of its earth and water energies. As such, save for when the Kojin blasted a hole in the riverside wall during the Liberation Front’s siege, over the course of its six centuries, the castle has been little troubled by water. Instead, it was a fire that required the keep to be rebuilt on one of two occasions, the other being a planned reconstruction.The castle is of a circular shape, with the keep situated behind three concentric walls. Two of these have stood since the beginning, while the third and outermost was erected some 250 years later. Sadly, no number of walls could have stopped the Garleans and their aerial onslaught. Since its fall twenty-five years ago, the castle has been the seat of the viceroy, and its facilities were expanded to include hangars for magitek weaponry.Magitek HexadroneThis new model of warmachina was delivered to Doma Castle on the occasion of the inspection visit by Zenos yae Galvus, Legatus of the XIIth Imperial Legion. Though intended for open-field warfare, it saw emergency deployment when the castle came under siege and was destroyed by a band of adventurers.Hypertuned GrynewahtIn the early stages of his experiments into the Resonant, Aulus mal Asina, the XIIth Imperial Legion’s chief of research, conceived a means to augment the flesh with machina, and the much-changed Grynewaht who joined Doma Castle’s defense was a product of this technique. Attached to the Roegadyn’s back was a contraption that siphoned out his blood and infused it with fortifying chemicals.MoreWith its vibrant ornamentation, the keep’s interior was a veritable treat for the eyes. However, surrounded by her enemies, the acting viceroy Yotsuyu goe Brutus resorted to destroying the keep with explosives, leaving naught but rubble where once it proudly stood.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
