Swallow's Compass10Discover every location withinthe Swallow's Compass.-4.3ImagesGear Imagescontest submissionDungeon ImagesLoreThe Birthplace Of Doman GeomancyChiseled into the great wall which cuts across the plains of Yanxia, between two of the Dairyu Moon Gates, is the visage of Ganen, the legendary hero who united Doma. The first king of the new kingdom was not only a military genius, but also a master geomancer, and after his death this royal mausoleum became a holy site to which his disciples would make pilgrimage. Even from Hingashi and beyond, academics and monks would come to gather at what is known as the birthplace of Doman geomancy.Such scholarly congregations were dispersed by the invading Empire. Deeming the near-deified Ganen a potential primal threat, the imperial viceroy of Doma ordered the king’s tomb sealed shut. The geomancers' place of study was abandoned, and the Swallow’s Compass fell into disrepair.Qitian DashengAs with others of his ilk, this simian auspice gained divine might after enduring a millennium of life. Qitian Dasheng, whose title means “Great Sage, Heaven’s Equal,” dwells in the Swallow's Compass to prevent his master's creation—the tamate-bako of geomancy—from, falling into unscrupulous hands.DaidarabotchiDescribed in ancient legend, these gargantuan entities are said to be the creators of mountains or lakes. Pronunciation differs slightly by region, with minor variations such as “deidarabotchi.” But whatever the name given, attempts by a succession of occultists to bring this legendary being to life has resulted in the conception of countless abominations. The Swallow's Compass geomancers, too, appeared unable to resist creating their own watery behemoth.MoreThe art of geomancy, with its command over wind , earth , and water , can be employed as a method for constructing Tenkonto. Some few geomancers of the Swallow's Compass were capable of building the teleportation devices without the guidance of the Onishishu , but the knowl edge of their techniques is now all but lost.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
