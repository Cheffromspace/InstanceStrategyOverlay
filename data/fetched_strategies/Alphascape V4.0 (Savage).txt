Any player who jumps (or is pushed) over the edge will fall to an early doom, though they may be raised by a healer after a moderate delay. Unlike normal mode, players will also notice Omega's eye is present outside of the arena, gazing over the battle and taking part in various mechanics whilst players contend with Omega-M and Omega-F (seeSuppressionandAdvanced Suppression).Below is a list of mechanics related toOmega's Eye,Omega-M(individually),Omega-F(individually), andOmega-M+F(simultaneously), followed by each phase being explained via a mechanical timeline so you'll know what to expect (and when).General MechanicsOmega's Eye- all players must be wary of the large mechanical eyeball located outside of the arena. Periodically, it will alter its position and unleash either a straight-line or point-blank AoE across the platform. At the beginning of the battle,Omega's Eyewill always be positioned to the north, and will only move tocardinalpoints around the arena (N, S, E, W).Suppression- causesOmega's Eyeto unleash a massive straight-line AoE across the arena, leaving small safe zones to the sides of the beam. After doing so,Omega's Eyewill teleport to another cardinal position.Advanced Suppression- causesOmega's Eyeto unleash a massive point blank AoE from its location, leaving a crescent moon area (farthest away from the eye) as a safe spot. After doing so,Omega's Eyewill teleport to another cardinal position.Electric Slide- causes Omega-M and/or Omega-F to devolve into a non-targetable puddle of synthetic goop. Shortly afterwards, both healers will be targeted with a stack marker, forcing the raid to split into two groups and stack with each victim to soak the damage. After a brief delay, the unformed goop will divide into two parts, with each part leaping towards a marked victim. After landing on the platform, Omega-M and Omega-F will form from the synthetic puddles. As a result, players can pre-position themselves so that Omega-M and Omega-F spawn in specific locations, keeping in mind that Omega-M will always castEfficient Bladework(point-blank AoE) at his location, whilst Omega-F castsDischarger(knockback).Omega-MNOTE: Whenever Omega-M is formed from synthetic goop, he will always castEfficient Bladework- a point-blank AoE at his current location (with no telegraph) before becoming active.Synthetic Shield- equips Omega-M with a synthetic shield that will allow him to execute specific abilities.Beyond Defense- causes Omega-M to dash towards a random player, inflicting moderate AoE damage and aMagic Vulnerability Updebuff against the primary target, as well as anyone else caught in the blast zone. As a result, the raid should avoid stacking duringBeyond Defenseto ensure that the damage and debuffs do not overlap onto other players.Beyond Defenseis immediately followed byPile Pitch.Pile Pitch- a direct follow-up toBeyond Defense- which causes Omega-M to select a random target and blast the victim with a shareable AoE attack. The raid will need to stack up to share the damage ofPile Pitch, except for the previous victim ofBeyond Defense, who will still be suffering fromMagic Vulnerability Up.Seeing as one attack requires avoiding players whilst the other requires stacking, players should spread evenly within the safe-zones of upcomingSuppressionbeams, wait for a player to be hit byBeyond Defense, and then have everyone except the victim stack together to absorb the follow-up attack.Omega-FNOTE:Whenever Omega-F is formed from synthetic goop, she will always castDischarger- a raidwide knockback from her location before becoming active.Synthetic Blades- causes Omega-F to morph her legs into sharpened blades that will allow her to execute specific abilities.Superliminal Motion- causes Omega-F to charge up a 300 degree AoE directly in front of her, leaving only a thin safe-spot directly behind her.Optimized Fire III- causes Omega-F to blast all members of the raid simultaneously with a flaming AoE. Bear in mind thatOptimized Fire IIIhas no telegraph nor cast-time, thus all players must learn exactly when the ability will be used throughout the encounter and move to pre-assigned positions or patterns to avoid overlapping each other with damage.Optimized Blizzard III- creates two straight-line AoEs across the arena through Omega-F's front and sides, forming a cross-shape (+). For the sake of ease, it is always wise to have Omega-F facing a cardinal direction (such as north) so that the AoEs remain predictable. Bear in mind thatOptimized Blizzard IIIis typically followed byOptimized Fire III.Omega-M+FFirewall- causes Omega-M and Omega-F to inflictPacket Filter (M or F)onto nearby players, rendering them incapable of damaging the other Omega form for as long as the debuff persists.Resonance: (Local) or (Remote)- provides Omega-M and Omega-F with lethal damage buffs depending on their proximity to the other form. IfResonance (Local)is active, both forms will need to be kept separate from each other to prevent both forms from gaining lethal damage. The opposite is true forResonance (Remote), requiring both forms to be kept close together to avoid the lethal damage buffs. The initial cast ofResonanceis random, whereas the second cast will always involve the version that was not previously used. For example, if the first cast ofResonanceis (Local), the next will always be (Remote).Fundamental Synergy- causes Omega-M and Omega-F to place markers (numbered from 1-to-4) on their respective half of the raid - blue markers for Omega-M and purple markers for Omega-F (seeFirewall). After a brief delay, each form will start dashing towards their numbered targets (1, 2, 3, 4), inflicting AoE damage and applyingMagic Vulnerability Upto each victim and any player overlapping the target. Furthermore, the damage is greatly increased depending on how close consecutive targets are to each other during collisions.A typical method of handlingFundamental Synergyis to have all odd-numbered players (1 & 3) move to the opposite side of the platform, making sure not to stand anywhere near other players. By doing so, each Omega form will criss-cross a large distance per numbered target, preventing players from taking colossal (or even fatal) damage. Players will be unable to avoid receiving at least oneMagic Vulnerability Updebuff, thus it is imperative that everyone avoids overlapping seeing as further collisions from either Omega-M and Omega-F (on an already debuffed player) will likely be fatal.Laser Shower- bombards the arena with unavoidable raidwide damage.Solar Ray- a vicious tankbuster against both tanks, dealing major damage in a small area around each victim. As a result, all non-tanks should make sure that they are not standing anywhere near either tank duringSolar Raycasts.Operational Synergy- typically cast afterSynthetic Blades(Omega-F) orSynthetic Shield(Omega-M) to signify an upcoming mini-phase of overlapping mechanics from both forms at the same time.Operational Synergy (Shield Version):Players will need to contend withBeyond Defense(Omega-M) +Optimized Blizzard III(Omega-F), followed by an immediatePile Pitch(Omega-M) +Optimized Fire III(Omega-F). From here, players will have to avoidBeyond Strength- a donut AoE covering the entire platform with a safe spot directly inside Omega-M's hitbox - followed byEfficient Bladework(point-blank AoE), forcing the raid to run from the safe spot, with Omega-F casting aLaser Shower. The mini-phase ends with an additionalLaser Showerfrom both forms.Operational Synergy (Blades Version):Players will need to deal withSuperliminal Steel, forming two straight-line AoEs at the sides of the arena (relative to the direction Omega-F is facing), leaving a safe strip through the center. If Omega-F is facing north, for example, then the east and west of the arena will be marked with AoEs, whilst a vertical strip (from north to south) will be present through the middle of the arena. As soon asSuperliminal Steelresolves, Omega-F will unleash anOptimized Blizzard III, whilst Omega-M usesPile Pitch(forcing them to avoid straight-line AoEs as a stacked group to absorb the damage of Omega-M's attack).Superliminal Motionwill trigger, forcing the raid to stand in a tiny safe spot directly behind Omega-F, shortly followed byEfficient Bladework(point-blank AoE from Omega-M), forcing the raid to retreat from that safe-spot as soon as possible. Whilst retreating, all players will be bombarded withOptimized Fire IIIfrom Omega-F, followed byLaser Showerfrom Omega-M. Just like the other mini-phase, the end is signified by both forms casting a unifiedLaser Showertogether.NOTE:The battle involves two casts ofOperational Synergy. The first version is always random, whilst the second will always be the version that wasn't used previously.Limit Break PhaseBefore transitioning to the second phase of the battle, Omega-M and Omega-F will bombard the raid with their own versions of commonLimit Breaks, as well as previously explained mechanics.Optimized Meteor- applies a proximity marker to a random tank, marking them as the upcoming victim of a ranged-magicLimit Break 3, forcing them to run as far away from the group to reduce overall raid damage.Optimized Sagittarius Arrow- applies an orange marker to a random tank, making them as the upcoming victim of a ranged-physicalLimit Break 3. Once cast, Omega-M will unleash a column AoE from himself through the marked target. As a result, the marked tank must try to aim the attack away from the rest of the group.Cosmo Memory- inflicts massive raidwide damage.Laser Shower x2- bombards the arena with unavoidable raidwide damage.Optimized Bladedance- causes Omega-M and Omega-F to target a tank (one each) and attempt to annihilate them with a physical-meleeLimit Break 2.Phase 1: Mechanical TimelineHere's a quick run-down of the mechanical timeline:Synthetic Shield- always cast at the beginning of the battle.Suppression- a large straight-line AoE fromOmega's Eyewill 'eventually' shoot across the platform before the eye changes position.Beyond Defense- raid splits up to avoid overlapping damage.Pile Pitch- raid stacks to absorb damage, excluding the victim ofBeyond Defense.Suppressionwill land at this point.Subject Simulation- causes Omega-M to morph into Omega-F, who will then unleashDischarger(knockback) from her location.Synthetic Blades- always cast after Omega-F is initially spawned.Advanced Suppression- a large conal AoE will 'eventually' shoot fromOmega's Eye(covering about 1/2 of the platform).Superliminal Motion- a 300-degree cone, forcing the raid to stand directly behind Omega-F to avoid it.Advanced Suppressionwill land at this point.Optimized Fire III- blasts all participants with an AoE circle of fire. Has no telegraph or cast-bar, thus everyone must ensure they are spread out.Subject Simulation- causes Omega-F to morph into non-targetable goop.Electric Slide- stack markers on both healers, forcing the raid to split evenly and soak the damage. Once concluded, Omega-M and Omega-F will form, unleashingEfficient Bladework(Omega-M - point-blank AoE) andDischarger(Omega-F - knockback).Firewall- both forms inflictPacket Filteronto nearby players, rendering them incapable of damaging the other form.Resonance- casts either (Local) or (Remote)Resonance, forcing the raid to split both forms (Local) or keep them together (Remote).Advanced Suppression- a large conal-AoE will 'eventually' shoot fromOmega's Eye(covering about 1/2 of the platform).Fundamental Synergy- both forms mark their half of the raid with numbers from 1-4. Odd-numbered players from each group should retreat to opposite sides of the arena, with the entire raid ensuring they do not stack with any other player.Advanced Suppressionwill land about midway throughFundamental Synergy.Laser Shower- bombards the entire raid with unavoidable damage.Solar Ray- simultaneously blasts each tank with a tankbuster.Synthetic ShieldorSynthetic Bladesfollowed byOperational Synergy. A mini-phase will follow depending on whetherShieldorBladeswas cast.Operational Synergy (Shield Version):Beyond Defense+Optimized Blizzard III>>Pile Pitch+Optimized Fire III>>Beyond Strength>>Efficient Bladework+Laser Shower. The mini-phase ends with an additionalLaser Showerfrom both forms.Operational Synergy (Blades Version):Superliminal Steel>>Optimized Blizzard III+Pile Pitch>>Superliminal Motion>>Efficient Bladework>>Optimized Fire III+Laser Shower. The mini-phase ends with an additionalLaser Showerfrom both forms.Firewall- both forms inflictPacket Filteronto nearby players once again.Resonance- casts either (Local) or (Remote)Resonance- whichever wasnotused previously.Advanced Suppression- a large conal AoE will 'eventually' shoot fromOmega's Eye(covering about 1/2 of the platform).Fundamental Synergy- both forms mark their half of the raid with numbers from 1-4. Handled in the same way as before.Advanced Suppressionwill once again land about midway throughFundamental Synergy.Laser Shower- unavoidable raid damage.Solar Ray- unified tankbusters.Synthetic ShieldorSynthetic Blades(whichever wasnotused before the previousOperational Synergy), leading to the alternate mini-phase (see above).Suppression- a large straight-line AoE fromOmega's Eyewill 'eventually' shoot across the platform before the eye changes position.Optimized Meteor+Optimized Sagittarius Arrow- both tanks receive aLimit Breaktank buster.Meteoris a proximity marker,Arrowis a straight-like AoE that can be aimed away from the raid.Suppressionwill land whilst the limit breaks are being executed.Cosmo Memory- extreme raidwide damage.Laser Shower x 2- more raidwide damage.Optimized Bladedance- both tanks receive a physical Limit Break tankbuster.Advanced Suppression- a large conal-AoE will 'eventually' shoot fromOmega's Eye(covering about 1/2 of the platform).Optimized Meteor+Optimized Sagittarius Arrow- both tanks receiveLimit Breaksonce again (proximity + straight-line).Advanced Suppressionwill land whilst the limit breaks are being executed.Cosmo Memory x 2- extreme raidwide damage.Laser Shower x 2- even more raidwide damage.Optimized Bladedance- both tanks receive another physical Limit Break tankbuster.Cosmo Memory- enrage version.Assuming the raid defeats Omega-M and Omega-F before theCosmo Memory Enrage, Omega will transition into its final form, activating acheckpoint. Should the raid wipe for any reason after this point, the fight will reset to the checkpoint (rather than reset back to the very beginning).Phase 2 - Mechanics & AbilitiesHaving transformed into its ultimate form, all further wipes will reset the battle to phase 2 (rather than the very beginning). Here's a list of all mechanics and abilities used throughout the phase, followed by a mechanical timeline which lists those abilities in the order they are used.Target Analysis- targets one of the two players that currently have the highest enmity (typically one of the tanks) with a circular (blue) marker. Once targeted, the chosen player will receive aMagic Vulnerability Updebuff. Once applied, Omega will immediately prepare to blast its primary target withSavage Wave Cannon- which involves magic damage.Savage Wave Cannon- a vicious tankbuster against Omega's primary target (in the form of a straight-line AoE beam) that can be rendered non-lethal by sharing it with a fellow tank. The brunt of its damage will be applied to the closest target, thus if being shared between two tanks, the one withMagic Vulnerability Up(Target Analysis) should make sure they are standingbehindthe non-debuffed tank. Alternatively, immunity cooldowns can be used to soak the beam individually.Patch- tethers each tank and healer to a random damage dealer with one of two color tethers - eitherblue(Remote Regression) orreddish-green(Local Regression). Depending on the type of tether, it will explode if the connected players move too close (red-green / local), or too far away from each other (blue - remote). Whenever a tether explodes, the entire raid will suffer unavoidable damage and receive 2 stacks ofMagic Vulnerability Up(which lasts for 2 seconds). All tethers will remain connected until they have been intentionally exploded and will typically overlap through various mechanics. Thanks to the debuffs applied with each explosion, the goal is to methodically explode tethers at a slower pace, as popping too many too quickly will overwhelm the entire raid with increased debuff stacks (thus higher damage).Seeing as they cannot be removed too quickly thanks to the damage and debuffs per explosion, players will be dealing withPatchtethers throughout multiple upcoming mechanics. Also, a future mechanic will forcefully detonate any remaining tethers and instantly kill players, thus the group should organize a timely and efficient tether-popping rotation that will not overwhelm their healers.Diffuse Wave Cannon- causes Omega to fire beams across the arena from either its front & rear or from both of its sides. Thankfully, players will be able to discern where beams will be fired by paying attention to the charge-up animation. Whilst charging up, three noticeable orbs will be present either at Omega's front & rear, or its sides. As a rule of thumb, the area where orbs are located are essentially the safe spot. For example, if you notice three orbs in-front and/or behind Omega,Diffuse Wave Cannonwill be fired from its sides.Oversampled Wave Cannon- causes Omega to summon a collection of computer monitors at a random direction around its hitbox. After a delay, Omega will target two random players in the direction the monitors are facing and simultaneously blast them with large AoE circle tankbusters. Due to the aiming component, all non-tanks should make sure that they stand away from where the monitors are facing (preferably behind the boss), whereas both tanks should move towards where the monitors are facing to select themselves for the tankbusters. Due to being large AoE circles, the damagecanoverlap, so make sure you do not stack with your fellow tank whilst being blasted.Ion Efflux- Omega peppers the entire raid with very high levels of unavoidable damage. Also, any unresolvedPatchtethers will be forcefully detonated byIon Efflux, causing tethered players to instantly die.Hello, World #1- causes Omega to teleport to the center of the platform and bombard the raid with unavoidable damage, followed by a collection of varied debuffs against the majority of the raid that each has to be dealt with in different ways.Debuff: Critical Overflow Bug- an 8-second durability debuff against a random tank. Once the debuff expires, the debuffed player will suffer major damage and unleash a massive AoE circle at their location that can transfer freshCritical Overflow Bugdebuffs to anyone hit by the blast - excluding the exploded player, who instead will receive aDebuggerdebuff, rendering them immune to furtherCritical Overflow BugandCritical Synchronization Bugapplications - (see below).Debuff: Critical Synchronization Bug- applied to two random damage dealers (unaffected byCritical Overflow Bug). One debuff will have a 12-second duration while the other will have an 8-second duration. After expiring, the debuff will cause affected players to explode, dealing moderate damage and emitting medium-sized AoE circles at their location which will applyCritical Synchronization Bugto anyone caught in the blast. Just likeCritical Overflow Bug, exploded players will receiveDebugger, rendering them immune to further applications ofCritical Overflow BugandCritical Synchronization Bugdebuffs (see above).Debuff: Latent Defect- a 10-second durability debuff against a random tank (whichever is not effected byCritical Overflow Bug), a random healer, and a random damage dealer. If not cleansed before expiring, the affected player(s) will instantly be slain. To cleanseLatent Defect, afflicted players must be hit by (any) source of damage.NOTE:One healer and one damage dealer will receive absolutely no debuffs fromHello, World. Seeing as twoBugdebuffs can re-apply themselves to anyone withoutDebugger, and seeing as two players can only cleanseLatent Defectby taking damage, the raid will need to organize a plan to resolve all debuffs successfully.As a rule of thumb, it is wise to keep Omega at a cardinal position (such as north, south, east, or west - right at the edge of the platform) and use all remaining cardinal points as 'explosion' points forCritical Synchronization BugandCritical Overflow Bug. In the beginning, only one player (a tank) will have the massive (Overflow) explosion, whereas two players (damage dealers) will have the medium (Synchronization) explosions and will need to share this damage with at least one other player each. Players withLatent Defectcan choose to share the medium explosion or take damage from the large explosion - bearing in mind that they will receive the same debuff as a result and will need to use the safe zones for their explosions. Alternatively, players withDebugger(previously exploded players) can help soak freshly createdSynchronizationdebuffs as they will no longer be able to receive the debuff.How you choose to handle the overlap is entirely optional, though utilizing extreme cardinal points as explosive safe-spots will give you the freedom to assign positions and orders for each debuff type.Critical Error- afflicts raidwide damage and appliesDebuff: Critical Overflow Bugto all players that do not haveDebugger, forcing the affected players to utilize previously assigned safe-spots to unleash a new wave of massive AoE explosions. Assuming the above mini-phase of debuffs were handled successfully,Critical Errortypically results in three players being debuffed.Archive Peripheral- creates three mechanical arms at the outer edge of the platform that will telegraph straight-line AoEs across the platform, along with a 'rotation' indicator, showing that each AoE will also rotate in a clockwise or counter-clockwise pattern (depending on the indicator) once they begin to fire. Despite some element of randomness, there will always be one safe spot within the arena that the raid must stand in to avoid suffering tremendous damage. During the first cast ofArchive Peripheral, Omega will also castTarget Analysis- the soakable tankbuster from earlier - forcing the raid to not only avoid the rotating beams but also allow enough space for tanks to share the straight-line AoE without clipping the raid.Index & Archive Peripherals- creates three mechanical arms at the outer edge of the platform that will tether themselves to a random player each. After a delay, these mechanical arms will fire straight-line AoEs in the direction of the tethered players. Simultaneously, Omega will utilizeWave Cannon, aiming straight-line AoEs at the closest players. All AoEs will be unleashed at the same time, thus the raid must co-ordinate themselves into a star pattern so that no AoEs overlap onto other players. An easy way to accomplish this is to have all tethered players move to the outer edge of the arena (directly opposite from the hands they are tethered to) whilst all non-tethered players stand in between the tethered patterns (close to the boss) to bait theWave Cannonblasts. By doing so, beams will be fired towards cardinal and inter-cardinal positions with no overlap.Archive All- creates mechanical arms around the outer edge of the platform that will begin to castColossal Blow, causing them to detonate in a broad area and inflict fatal damage upon anyone caught in the blast. To complicate matters, a massive and rotating straight-line AoE will repeatedly fire while slowly twisting in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion. Furthermore, Omega will also castElectric Slide, causing itself to turn in a specific direction and eventually charge, dealing proximity-based damage when it collides with the edge of the arena.Players will need to quickly identify which direction the beam will rotate, as well as which direction Omega is facing forElectric Slide. Once these factors are recognized, the raid can identify which mechanical arm is (a) on the opposite side ofElectric Slidecollision and (b) will not be cleaved by the rotating beam. Once identified, the raid will need to destroy the mechanical arm as soon as possible to create a safe spot. Alas, Omega will complicate this matter further by usingDelta Attack.Delta Attack- causes one random player to acquire a stack marker, four players to acquire delayed circle-AoEss, and multiple players to drop circle AoEs beneath their feet. Due to the rotatingArchive Allbeam (and the need to destroy the chosen mechanical arm beforeColossal Blowcauses them to explode), players will have very limited space and time to deal with the overlap. In short, everyone must run away as a group to avoid the AoE circles dropped on the ground, then have the stack-marked player move back into position and share damage with unmarked players whilst everyone with delayed circle AoEs spread out (away from the stack mark) to detonate safely.Colossal Blowwill detonate shortly afterDelta Attackresolves, thus the raid must destroy their chosen mechanical arm beforehand to avoid devastating results.Hello, World #2- causes Omega to teleport to the center and bombard the raid with unavoidable damage and debuffs, just like earlier, except this time, a new debuff (Critical Underflow Bug) will be added to the mini-phase, and the arena will also contain soakable light-pillars which (if left unsoaked) will detonate and destroy the raid.Extra Debuff: Critical Underflow Bug- 15-second duration debuff against the healer who was not affected byLatent Defect. Once the debuff expires, the healer explodes, killing any players who are clipped by the blast. Unlike all the other debuffs,Underflowcan be transferred to another player by making contact with them, and by doing so, the player who transferred the debuff will acquire a specialDebugger, rendering them immune to the effect. As a result, the raid will need to contend with all the previous debuffs (and the new light pillars) whilst passing around the new debuff so that the entire raid becomes immune to it via transfer.Debuff: Critical Overflow Bug- 8-second durability debuff vs random tank resulting in a large detonation that can transfer the debuff to players who do not haveDebugger(just like before).Debuff: Critical Synchronization Bug- applied to two random damage dealers - one with 8-second durability and one with 12-second durability - both resulting in a moderate detonation that can transfer the debuff to players who do not haveDebugger(just like before).Debuff: Latent Defect- 10-second durability debuff against a random healer, a random damage dealer, and whichever tank did not getOverflow. Just like before, the debuff can be cleansed by being hit by a source of debuff related damage. Failure to do so will result in instant death once the debuff expires.Cascading Latent Defect- represented by three circular pillars of light through the center of the arena that requires at least one player withCritical Underflow Bugto stand inside or the pillars will explode, inflicting fatal damage to the entire raid. Furthermore, players who successfully soak a pillar will be affected byLatent Defect, forcing them to intentionally take damage to cleanse themselves.NOTE:The light pillars will spawn mid-way through expiring debuffs, forcing even more coordination as before. In short, players will need to handle the debuffs similarly to the previousHello, World, except now, they will also need to intentionally pass the newOverflowdebuff to other players so that the light-pillars can be soaked.Much like before, it is wise to keep Omega at a cardinal position (such as north, south, east, or west - right at the edge of the platform) and use all remaining cardinal points as 'explosion' points forCritical Synchronization BugandCritical Overflow Bug. How you choose to handle the overlap is mostly optional, though bear in mind that players assigned to soak light-pillars will need to take damage to cleanse their newly acquiredLatent Defectdebuffs.Assuming the raid successfully handles the secondHello, World, Omega will cycle through the same mechanics as it did before the first one. However, on reaching the point where anotherHello, Worldwould be cast, it will instead useProgram Omega- a soft enrage.Program Omega- causes Omega to repeatedly castIon Efflux, gaining a stackableDamage Upbuff with each successful cast. On reaching 5 stacks ofDamage Up, Omega will obliterate the raid with one final cast ofIon Efflux.Phase 2: Mechanical TimelineHere's a quick run-down of the mechanical timeline:Target Analysis- appliesMagic Vulnerability Upto one of the two players with the highest enmity.Savage Wave Cannon- blasts the primary target with a shareable tankbuster. Tank withMagic Vulnerability Upshould stand behind the other tank to share it or they'll likely take fatal damage.Patch- connects each tank and healer to a random damage dealer with local (red) or remote (blue) tether. Tethers must be popped methodically by moving close to (or away from) their partner. One set of tethers should be popped as soon asPatchhas been cast.Diffuse Wave Cannon- Omega fires beams towards the front & rear, or to the sides. Safe spots/directions will be indicated by three glowing orbs. Another pair of players should intentionally explode theirPatchtether at this point.Oversampled Wave Cannon- tanks stand in the direction of monitors and spread apart for AoE tankbusters. Everyone else moves out of the direction of monitors to avoid being selected. Another pair of players should intentionally explode theirPatchtether at this point.Ion Efflux- raidwide damage that will also slay any players who haven't removed theirPatchtethers. The final pair of tethers will need to be exploded. Do not leave it too late as the resulting debuffs will cause the entire raid to take increased damage.Hello, World #1- raidwide damage accompanied by various debuffs that need to be handled in specific ways.Overflow + Synchronization- all 8 second duration debuffs will detonate first. Players need to coordinate themselves into safe spots to avoid (or intentionally take) damage from exploding players, remembering thatSynch(medium) explosions need to be soaked by an additional player each.Latent Defect- 10-second duration debuffs detonate, slaying anyone who has not removed them by taking damage.Synchronization- 12 second duration debuffs will detonate.Re-Applied Debuffs- Variable depending on how the raid decided to handle the above.Critical Error- inflicts raidwide damage and appliesCritical Overflow Bugto anyone who doesn't haveDebugger.Ion Efflux- raidwide damage.Archive Peripheral- rotating beams from mechanical arms, forcing the raid to locate the only safe spot that will be formed.Target Analysis- appliesMagic Vulnerability Upto one of the two players with the highest enmity. Happens duringArchive Peripheralbeams.Savage Wave Cannon- shareable tankbuster. Happens duringArchive Peripheralbeams. Tank withMagic Vulnerability Upmust be extra careful.Diffuse Wave Cannon- Omega fires beams towards the front & rear, or to the sides, same as before.Oversampled Wave Cannon- tanks stand in the direction of monitors and spread apart for AoE tankbusters (whilst everyone else moves away from the monitor direction), same as before.Index & Archive Peripherals- mechanical arms tether to random players and prepare to fire straight-line AoEs at them.Wave Cannon- Omega prepares to shoot straight-line AoEs at the closest players. Raid forms a star-pattern by having non-tethered targets stand near the boss (in-between tethered targets, who stand at the outer edges of the arena, opposite their respective arms).Target Analysis- appliesMagic Vulnerability Upto one of the two players with the highest enmity.Savage Wave Cannon- shareable tankbuster. Happens duringArchive Peripheralbeams. Tank withMagic Vulnerability Upmust be extra careful.Patch- connects each tank and healer to a random damage dealer with local (red) or remote (blue) tether. Tethers must be popped methodically, just like before.Diffuse Wave Cannon- Omega fires beams towards the front & rear, or to the sides, just like before.Oversampled Wave Cannon- tanks stand in the direction of monitors and spread apart for AoE tankbusters. Everyone else moves out of the direction of monitors to avoid being selected.Ion Efflux- raidwide damage that will also slay any players who haven't removed theirPatchtethers. The final pair of tethers will need to be exploded beforehand.Archive All- creates mechanical arms around the outer edge of the platform that will begin to castColossal Blow. Players will need to destroy one as soon as possible to create a safe spot. Simultaneously, a rotating straight-line AoE will repeatedly fire while slowly twisting in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion.Electric Slide- Omega turns in a specific direction and charges, inflicting proximity-based damage when it collides with the edge of the arena. All players should be focusing on a mechanical arm in the opposite direction of where Omega is about to charge.Delta Attack- marks one player with a stack marker, four players with circle-AoEs, and causes most of the raid to drop circle AoEs beneath their feet. Players must dodge the floor circles, spread out their circle AoEs, and soak the stack marker whilst also destroying their chosen mechanical armandavoiding the rotating beam.Colossal Blowconcludes afterDelta Attack, wiping the raid if the chosen arm wasn't destroyed in time.Diffuse Wave Cannon- Omega fires beams towards the front & rear, or to the sides, just like before.Hello, World #2- raid wide damage accompanied by various debuffs, just like before, except for a new debuff (Critical Underflow Bug) and three soakable light-pillars (Cascading Latent Defect).Cascading Latent Defect- forms three light-pillars in a straight line through the arena center that can only be soaked by players affected byCritical Underflow Bug.
