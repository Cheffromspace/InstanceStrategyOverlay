Your evolution is at hand.— In-game descriptionAlphascape V3.0 (Savage)is a level 70raidintroduced inpatch 4.4withStormblood. The raid is also known asO11S.Contents1Strategy1.1Omega1.1.1Opening Phase1.1.2Add Phase1.1.2.1Executable #11.1.2.2Executable #21.1.2.3Delta Attack1.1.3Post Delta Attack2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 2StrategyOmegaNote that unlike Normal mode, players can fall off the edge of the arena to their death, although they can be resurrected after a short delay. In addition, theOmega JammerDuty Action is unavailable to use in the Savage encounter.Opening PhaseAtomic Ray- inflicts unavoidable raidwide damage.Mustard Bomb- a vicious tankbuster against Omega's primary target that deals damage in a very small area. Insavagemode,Mustard Bombwill also apply a short durationBleedeffect (6 seconds).Flame Thrower- targets all active players and blasts them with a flaming cone-AoE from the center of Omega's hitbox. After dousing players in flame, Omega will follow-up with a blast of blue flame (Afterburner) in the same shape and direction as the previous flame thrower blast. Players hit byFlame Throwerwill receive moderate damage, whereas those hit byAfterburnerwill suffer far greater damage and a heftyknockback. Everyone will need to bait the initial flame blast (without stacking on other players), then side-step theAfterburner. One easy method of accomplishing this is to have all players form a circle around Omega's hitbox - usually in a cardinal and inter-cardinal fashion - so that once the flames have been fired, the raid can rotate in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction into their safe spot to avoid theAfterburner(follow-up blast).Wave Cannon- comes in two variations -Larboard Wave CannonandStarboard Wave Cannon. Larboard shoots from Omega'sleftside, while Starboard does the same for itsrightside. Getting hit will deal very high damage and inflictVulnerability Up. After using a Wave Cannon attack, Omega will spin around to face the opposite direction and use a second Wave Cannon attack in an attempt to confuse players. It helps to remember that "Larboard" =Left. If it's not larboard, it's to Omega's right. The savage version of wave cannon no longer has a telegraph, though this is of little consequence considering how short the telegraph was in normal mode.Peripheral Synthesis#1- spawns a total of six (small)rocket-punchadds - half of which will be blue and the other half yellow - at the location of all fourdamage dealersand bothhealers, tracking their movements. After a brief delay, each fist will launch itself at the current location of the players that spawned them. If two fists of the same color collide with each other as a result, they will explode, dealing massive raidwide damage and afflicting nasty debuffs upon the group. However, if two fists of opposite color collide with each other, they will destroy themselves at no detriment to the group, leaving behind a collectable damage-up buff (Live Wire).Due to the colors being random, it is up to the raid to position themselves and quickly mix-and-match the upcoming collisions so that no two same-color fists launch into each other. A simple method of achieving this is to have the group divide into three pairs (excluding the tanks - who will not spawn a fist) and have the three groups form a semi-circle around the boss. Once the fists have spawned, players will be able to identify their color (yellow or blue) and see if their fists are of opposite colors. If so, the pair can remain in place and bait their fists into colliding with each other. If a pair of players have identical colored fists, then one player from that pair can swap with a player from a different pair as needed.Add PhaseIt won't be long before Omega exit's the arena, leaving behind circular electro-puddles in the center and around the outer edges that will instantly kill anyone standing in them (or walking through them) when it finishes forming, just like normal mode. Once the arena has been augmented, aLevel Checkerwill spawn in the central AoE and begin to cast variousExecutables.Executable #1Executable #1- inflicts aLooperdebuff on all players, the duration of which will always be just below 14 seconds. If a player fails to dispel theLooperdebuff for any reason, they will lose control of their character, forcing them to run around aimlessly, possibly walking into fatal danger-zones or being incapable of fulfilling important mechanics. To dispel theLooperdebuff, players must successfully soak upcomingmeteormechanics.Storage Meteors- creates four large yellow circles within the arena; each circle requiring at least one player to stand inside them before their respective 'meteor' hits the arena. At this point in the battle, two circles will spawn at opposite sides of the central death-zone, while another two will spawn at opposite ends of the far edge of the arena. Players who successfully soak a tower will have theirLooperdebuff removed, thus the goal is to have a pair of players soak each tower so thatLooperdebuffs are removed from the whole group. However,Ferrofluid- apush/pullmechanic - will take place at the same time to complicate matters.Ferrofluid- tethers pairs of players together and marks everyone with positive & negative symbols, (+) & (-). After a moderate delay, tethered players with opposite symbols (+ & -) will bepulledtowards each other. Simultaneously, players with identical symbols (+ & + or - & -) will bepushedaway from each other.The goal is to quickly identifyFerrofluidsymbols and ensure that tethered pairs ofoppositesymbols move to the outer edge of the arena so that they are pulled intoStorage Meteorsnear the arena center. Meanwhile, tethered pairs ofsamesymbols will move close to the central death-zone and wait to be pushed into theStorage Meteorsat the far edges of the arena. If successful, all four meteors will be soaked and all eight players will have theirLooperdebuffs removed. If any meteor goes through, the entire raid will suffer moderate damage and be inflicted withDamage Down.NOTE:All players should pay attention to the pattern ofStorage MeteorsduringExecutable #1, as the pattern here will determine what the pattern will be inExecutable #2.Pattern #1: east & west meteors close to the level-checker + north & south meteors at the outer edge of the arena.Pattern #2: east & west meteors at the outer edge of the arena + north & south meteors close to the level-checker.Executable #2Executable #2- inflicts a new set ofLooperdebuffs on all members of the raid that must be dispelled in the same manner as before. However, theLooperdebuff will have varied durations per player: either 12 seconds, 21 seconds, or 29 seconds. Players with theshortestduration must cleanse their debuffs before those with higher durations.Chain of Memory- afflicts the two farthest players from theLevel Checkerwith a special debuff. While theChain of Memorydebuff is active, a visible straight-line AoE will be visible between the two affected players that will persist for the next half-a-minute. If any non-tethered players touch the purple line for any reason, they will succumb toconfusion, causing the victim to wander around aimlessly. To make matters worse, the two tethered players will suffer a stackable debuff (Memory Degradation) if they remain close together. If either player acquires six stacks ofMemory Degradation, they will becomeconfused.Storage Meteors- creates large yellow circles within the arena in a staggered fashion; each circle requiring at least one player to stand inside them before their respective 'meteor' hits the arena. Any player who successfully soaks a tower will have theirLooperdebuff removed. However, seeing asLooperhas been applied to all players with variable durations during thisExecutable, players with theshortestduration ofLoopermust soak towers first (or they will succumb toConfusionand likely perish).Reset- spawns a point-blank AoE underneath the level checker at various points throughout the tower-soaking process. All non-tethered players will need to move away from the level checker to avoid taking damage.The goal is to have the two tetheredChain of Memoryplayers soak the farthestStorage Meteorswhilst the rest of the group handle the meteors close to the level checker. Seeing asChain of Memoryis guaranteed to afflict the two farthest players from theLevel Checker, it is best to assign this task to two ranged damage dealers so that they can continue to damage the level checker whilst handling the upcoming tether. Simply have both players stand to the far east and west of the arena (forming a straight line through the level checker) so that onceChain of Memoryis cast, they will automatically become the targets.Meanwhile, the rest of the group will need to stack near the north or south of the Level Checker to avoid the upcomingChain of Memorytether. Whether they stack to the north or south will depend on the pattern ofStorage MeteorsduringExecutable #1.If Executable #1 = east & west meteors close to the level-checker + north & south meteors at the outer edge of the arena, then the group should stack to thesouthof the level checker.If Executable #1 = east & west meteors at the outer edge of the arena + north & south meteors close to the level-checker, then the group should stack to thenorthof the level checker.Once the group has been positioned, theStorage Meteorswill begin to spawn in a staggered circular fashion around the level checker and the outer edges of the arena. Non-tethered players with the lowest duration ofLooperwill need to soak first. As this continues, the two players tethered byChain of Memorywill need to move in a clockwise pattern so that they provide enough space for the rest of the group to soak the remaining level checker towers as they spawn, but also so that they rotate themselves into the two towers that will eventually spawn at the outer edges of the arena.Bear in mind thatReset, a point-blank AoE, will force the non-tethered players to move away from the level checker at various intervals, starting with the third successfully soaked tower.Once all towers have been successfully soaked, theChain of Memorytether will dissipate, and the level checker will omit a large donut AoE (Reformat), forcing everyone to move into the central safe-zone as soon as possible.Delta AttackWith bothExecutablesout of the way, the Level Checker will immediately begin to castForce Quit. If the Level Checker has not been defeated by the timeForce Quitis cast, the raid will suffer an unavoidable wipe.If the Level Checker is successfully defeated, Omega will appear at the outer edge of the arena and prepare to blast the raid with its devastatingDelta Attack- an unavoidable raid-blast. Unlike normal mode, players are not given a shield to survive the mechanic, so it is best to utilize a Limit Break 3 (Tank version) along with regular shields and healing to survive the ordeal.Post Delta AttackAfter surviving the raidwide blast, Omega returns to the platform and the fight resumes as normal.Ballistic Missiles- marks the entire group with AoE circles. Once detonated, all marked players will receive moderate damage and leave behind a persistent puddle of flame at their current location that will debuff players with a fatalBurnsdebuff if they remain inside for too long. Bear in mind thatBallistic Missileswill detonateafteran upcomingFlame Thrower(see below).Flame Thrower- targets all active players and blasts them with a flaming cone-AoE from the center of Omega's hitbox, followed by a blast ofAfterburnerin the same shape and direction as the previous blast. Just like earlier, all players will need to bait the initial flame blast, then side-step the follow-upAfterburnerblast, except now, everyone must do this with theBallistic Missiles(AoE circles) in mind. Simply form a distant circle around Omega just like in the first phase so that everyone can safely side-step theAfterburnerwith enough space to avoid overlappingBallistic MissileAoE circles as well. Due toBallistic Missilesleaving behind flaming puddles, make sure that nobody remains within Omega's hitbox when they detonate.Wave Cannon- peppers the raid with moreLarboard Wave Cannonand/orStarboard Wave Cannonwhile theBallistic Missileflame puddles exist. Remember - Larboard shoots from Omega'sleftside, while Starboard fires from therightside and Omega will spin 180 degrees after each blast to add more confusion. Assuming the raid has placed flaming puddles (Ballistic Missiles) outside of Omega's hitbox, they can now move into Omega's hitbox and safely react to Starboard or Larboard blasts without fear of walking into the puddles. After successfully dodging allWave Cannonattacks, the fire puddles fromBallistic Missileswill finally fade, giving the group more freedom.Mustard Bomb- the nasty tankbuster from earlier, except now, it is represented by a tether rather than manually cast against the primary target. Despite the minor difference in mechanic, the AoE component andBleedcomponent remain, so be sure to mitigateMustard Bombwhenever possible and take the hit away from the group. At the same time, players will also need to deal withBlaster- another tether mechanic (see below).Blaster- creates a tether between Omega and a random healer that must be picked up by whichever tank is not presently dealing withMustard Bomb. After detonation,Blasterwill inflict tremendous damage within a massive AoE circle and also applies a debilitatingHP Penaltyon the initial target. If the target was not full HP at the time of the blast, they will also receiveDoom. Tanks should grab this tether as soon as possible and move it as far away from the group as possible. Simultaneously, healers will need to ensure that the target is at full HP to prevent theDoomcomponent. Remember -BlasterandMustard Bombwill detonate at the same time, so be wary.Atomic Ray- inflicts unavoidable raidwide damage. Due to theHP PenaltyfromBlaster, the tank who handled the mechanic may need to utilize mitigation CD's (or extra shielding from healers) to survive.Peripheral Synthesis#2- spawns a total of four (large)rocket-punch- one at each edge of the arena (N,S,E,W) - that will tether to onetank, onehealer, and twodamage dealers. After a delay, all fists will then simultaneously launch in a straight line from one end of the arena to the other, inflicting damage, knock-back, andBlunt Resist Downagainst anyone caught in their wake. Due to theBlunt Resistcomponent, any tethered player hit by their tethered fist (and someone else's) will likely perish. While tethered, players can drag the fists left or right along their respective edge to reposition it before it launches across the platform.Example: If you are tethered to a large fist that has spawned at the northern edge of the arena, you can move the fist east or west along the northern edge, but the fist will always shoot in a straight line from north to south. If you are hit by someone else's fist as well as your own, theBlunt Resist Downcomponent will likely result in an untimely death.Due to the aiming component ofPeripheral Synthesis#2, all tethered players will need to position themselves so that fists do not punch through the raid (or other tethered players). A simple way of achieving this is to have two tethered players stand slightly apart from one another in a far corner of the arena (standing as close to their respective fist as possible), while the other tethered players do the same in the opposite corner. This will leave a safe-zone in the center of the arena for non-tethered players and prevent tethered players from being hit by other fists.Electric Slide- creates a stack-marker on a random player. After a brief delay, Omega launches itself into the targeted player's location, inflicting shareable damage. All players must stack on the selected player to save them from a grisly fate.Peripheral Synthesis#2- repeats the large fist mechanic, except this time, they will tether to the four players who wereNOTtethered previously (the other tank, the other healer, and the two other damage dealers). A tank-swap may be required to keep Omega in the center of the arena while the tethered players retreat to the corners.Wave Cannon- peppers the raid with moreLarboard Wave Cannonand/orStarboard Wave Cannon. Due to the knockback component of the previousPeripheral Synthesis#2, players who are out of position may need to sprint (or utilize gap-closers) to get close to Omega as soon as possible to better avoid the upcoming L/R blasts.Update Program- increases the damage inflicted by Omega's auto-attacks and also 'updates' upcoming mechanics by giving them additional components. For reference, mechanics effected byUpdate Programwill be described as(Updated)for the rest of the guide.(Updated) Flame Thrower- targets all active players and blasts them with a flaming cone-AoE from the center of Omega's hitbox, followed by a blast ofAfterburner. Thanks toUpdate Program, the initial blast will now applyBurnsto all players. Despite theBurnscomponent, both the initial blast (and follow-upAfterburner) are handled in the same manner as before.(Updated) Wave Cannon- Omega will utilize a Larboard(L) or Starboard(R) blast, then immediately follow up with a blast to the opposite side. This follow-up blast will not come with cast-times or telegraphs of any kind, so players will need to immediately rush to the opposite side of Omega after all Larboard or Starboard blasts.Pantokrator #1- a mini-phase that will spit out waves of mechanics.Firstly, unavoidable raidwide damage will be inflicted upon the group periodically, keeping healers on their toes for the entire duration ofPantokrator.Secondly, AoE circles will periodically spawn underneath four random players for the first half ofPantokrator(until four sets of AoE circles have been dropped). To save the raid from endangering themselves, have everyone stack together in one place and bait the AoE circles on top of each other while the group moves in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner.Thirdly, Omega will tag a random player with astack-line markerafter the fourth set of AoE circles. If players are avoiding the AoE circles by stacking on top of each other and moving around the boss in a controlled manner, then the stack-line component will be a minor inconvenience. Once the stack-line has been executed, the periodic 4xAoE circles will cease.Finally, after the stack-line marker has concluded, Omega will tag the four closest players with orange markers. After a delay, Omega will shoot large straight-line AoE's through the marked players, inflicting moderate damage and a stackableMagic Vulnerability Updebuff on anyone caught in the blasts. Omega will then bombard the raid with four circular AoE's before repeating the mechanic a second time. As a result, players who have tagged themselves (by being the closest four players to Omega) will need to ensure that they do not get tagged again, as the stackingMagic Vulnerability Upcomponent will cause previous victims to receive far greater (typically fatal) damage.After dodging the periodic AoE circles and soaking the stack-line marker, the raid will need to co-ordinate so that half the group gets marked (by being inside Omega's hitbox), bait the cannon blasts away from the rest of the group and then move away, allowing the other half of the raid to be marked and bait the canons again, preventingMagic Vulnerability Upfrom stacking up repeatedly on any players.Long Needle Kyrios- creates a proximity blast in the center of the arena, forcing all players to move to the outer edges to reduce upcoming damage. Due to upcoming mechanics, it is wise to have the entire group retreat to the same corner of the arena and allowing Omega to follow them into that corner afterLong Needle Kyrioshas concluded.Blaster- creates a tether between Omega and a random healer that must be picked up by the off-tank and dragged away from the group. Just like earlier,Blasterwill inflict tremendous damage within a massive AoE circle that also appliesHP Penaltyto the initial target. Remember - if the target was not full HP at the time of the blast, they will also receiveDoom, so make sure the tank who intercepts the tether is topped up.Atomic Ray- inflicts unavoidable raidwide damage. Due to theHP PenaltyfromBlaster, the tank who handled the mechanic may need to utilize mitigation CD's (or extra shielding from healers) to survive.Peripheral Synthesis#3- spawns a total of eight (small)rocket-punchadds (one per player) - all of which will be thesame color. After a brief delay, each fist will launch itself at the current location of the players that spawned them. If two fists collide with each other, they will destroy each other and inflict survivable damage. If more than two fists collide for any reason, the raid will suffer far greater raidwide damage instead. If fists do not collide at all, the fist(s) will repeat their leap-attacks until it collides with another fist (or until the player is slain).The raid has two choices:Option One: Bait the fists so that they explode in staggered pairs, dealing survivable/manageable damage with each pair.Option Two: Utilize a (Tank) Limit Break 3 so that the raid can bait all fists into punching into each other at the same time and survive the resulting blast. The second method is infinitely quicker (and arguably safer) than the first, yet doing so means the raid will not be able to utilize a damage-based Limit Break 3.No matter which method you choose, Omega will soon utilize:Mustard Bomb- the nasty tether-based tank buster.Atomic Ray- inflicts unavoidable raidwide damage.(Updated) Flame Thrower + Ballistic Missiles- marks the entire group with AoE circles that will leave behind persistent flame puddles after detonating. Simultaneously, players must content with the upgradedFlame Thrower(which appliesBurnsto all victims after the initial blast). Ultimately, this combination of mechanics is dealt with in the same manner as before. Simply form a large circle around Omega so that players can bait the initial blast ofFlame Throwerthen safely side-step the upcomingAfterburnerwithout overlapping their circles. Try not to drop any flame puddles inside Omega's hitbox!(Updated) Wave Cannon- Omega will utilize a Larboard(L) or Starboard(R) blast, then immediately follow up with a blast to the opposite side with no cast-time or telegraph. Players will need to move inside Omega's hitbox to avoid the previously dropped flame-puddles and remember to rush to the opposite side of Omega after all Larboard or Starboard blasts as soon as possible.Pantokrator #2- another mini-phase of mechanics (with two additional components and one altered mechanic to watch out for).(NEW) - Omega will begin to fire telegraphed cones ofFlame Throwerthat will essentially begin to travel around the arena in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion for the first-half ofPantokrator.(NEW) - Omega will periodically target the player farthest away from it withGuided Missile, causing them to drop a large AoE circle at their location for the first half ofPantokrator.(SAME) - Unavoidable raidwide damage will be inflicted upon the group periodically.(SAME) - AoE circles will periodically spawn underneath four random players for the first half ofPantokrator(until four sets of AoE circles have been dropped). Simply have everyone stack together in one place and bait the AoE circles on top of each other while the group moves in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner.(SAME) - Omega will tag a random player with astack-line markerhalf-way throughPantokrator(after the fourth set of AoE circles have been dropped). If players are avoiding the AoE circles (andFlame Thrower) by stacking on top of each other and moving around the boss in a controlled manner, then the stack-line component will be a minor inconvenience. Once the stack-line has been executed, the periodic 4xAoE circles (andFlame Thrower) will cease.(NEW) - After the stack-line marker has concluded, Omega will aim a massiveDiffuse Wave Cannon(massive cone AoE) in the direction of both tanks that will repeatedly fire untilPantokratorhas concluded. As a result, each tank will need to move away from each other (and the rest of the group) so that these cone-based attacks do not overlap onto each other. As soon as Omega begins to barrage both tanks withDiffuse Wave Cannon, Omega will also tag thethreeclosest players with orange markers. After a delay, Omega will shoot large straight-line AoE's through the marked players, inflicting moderate damage and a stackableMagic Vulnerability Updebuff on anyone caught in the blasts, then repeat the mechanic a second time.Players will need to handlePantokratorin a similar manner as before - except now, they also have to deal with a rotating cone of flame thrower and one player frequently being targeted with a larger AoE circle (Guided Missile) until the fourth set of AoE circles have been dropped. To handle this craziness, have the group stack up and bait the periodic AoE circles in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner like before. However, there is no guarantee that the rotatingFlame Throwerwill be clockwise or counter-clockwise, so you may need to change direction once it begins to rotate. Meanwhile, a player will need to bait theGuided Missileby being as far away from Omega (and the group) as possible. If you happen to have a tank with anInvulnerability Cooldown, you can cheeseGuided Missileby having that tank move to the far corner and completely negate them. If that isn't an option, it is best to assign a ranged damage-dealer to bait (and avoid) guided missile by rotating around the outer edge of the arena (away from the rest of the group) whilst maintaining damage on Omega.After the fourth set of AoE circles have been dropped, both tanks will need to move to one side of Omega (away from each other) so thatDiffuse Wave Cannondoesn't overlap fellow tanks or other players. Simultaneously, the rest of the group will need to stand on the opposite side of the tanks (away from theDiffuse Wave Cannonblasts) and bait the first three orange marks by standing inside Omega's hitbox. Once marked, straight-line AoE's will eventually be fired through the marked players, inflicting damage andMagic Vulnerability Upon anyone in their path, then the mechanic repeats once more. Thanks to the debuffs, the three previously unmarked players should move into Omega's hitbox to bait the second set of straight-line AoE's, allowing players withMagic Vulnerability Upto safely avoid them.Long Needle Kyrios- creates a proximity blast in the center of the arena, forcing all players to move to the outer edges to reduce upcoming damage. Due to upcoming mechanics, it is wise to have the entire group retreat to the same corner of the arena and allowing Omega to follow them into that corner afterLong Needle Kyrioshas concluded.(Updated) Wave Cannon x2- Omega will utilize a Larboard(L) or Starboard(R) blast, then immediately follow up with a blast to the opposite side (twice in succession). Remember - the follow-up blast will not come with cast-times or telegraphs of any kind, so players will need to immediately rush to the opposite side of Omega after all Larboard or Starboard blasts.Charybdis- reduces all members of the raid to 1 HP. It is wise to heal the tanks immediately, then the rest of the group.Mustard Bomb+ Blaster- the nasty tankbuster (tether) from earlier, along with aBlastertether between Omega and a random healer that must be picked up the off-tank. Due to being executed immediately afterCharybdis, Healers must prioritize healing the tanks as soon as possible beforeMustard BombandBlasterdetonate. Just like all previousBlasterattacks, it will inflict tremendous damage within a massive AoE circle and also applies a debilitatingHP Penalty, thus the off-tank should take the tether and move as far away from the group as soon as possible. Remember - if the tethered target is not full HP at the time of the blast, they will also receiveDoom.Atomic Ray x 3- inflicts unavoidable raidwide damage three times in succession. Due to theHP PenaltyfromBlasterand the previous cast ofCharybdis, healers are pressured to keep the entire group topped up as much as possible, especially the tank suffering from theHP Penaltyafflicted byBlaster.If still standing at this point in the battle, Omega will begin to long-castLOOP- a hard enrage. If successfully cast, the entire raid will suffer an unavoidable wipe.Loot30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsAlphascape Datalog v3.0Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityOmega Leg Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityOmega Head Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Hand Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1Omega Foot Gear Coffer (IL 400)OtherN/AABasic1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
