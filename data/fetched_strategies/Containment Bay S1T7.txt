Brought into being for the sole purpose of repelling theAllaganinvasion, Sephirot inflicted ruinous losses upon the imperial army before finally being subdued and imprisoned in the central facility ofAzys Lla. And now, millennia later, this immensely powerful entity threatens to awaken, his vengeful dreams disturbed by the careless ambitions ofArchbishop Thordan VII. Topple the first pillar of theWarring Triad, or wheresoever his colossal shadow falls shall be visited by unthinkable catastrophe!— In-game descriptionContainment Bay S1T7is a level 60trialintroduced inpatch 3.2withHeavensward.Contents1Strategy1.1The Fiend: Sephirot1.2Phase 11.3Phase 22Loot3ImagesStrategyThe Fiend:SephirotUpdated Shadowbringers GuideSephirot (Normal) GuideHe has no casting bars or ground indicators, so this fight is extra fun!Phase 1Generally, try and keep DPS and healers stacked up behind him for this phase.Fiendish Rage - 1 player is marked with the 4 arrows indicator. All other players should stack on them to share the damage.Ratzon - Approximately 6 players will get a small green AoE mark on them. These players should spread out to avoid stacking the damage taken.Ain - The arm air push. Sephirot will turn to face a random player and hold very still with his arms up. This attack has a 180-degree blast radius, has no cast and gives aVulnerability Updebuff on hit, but can easily avoided by stacking behind him.At the phase change (about 60% hp) he'll spawn Cochma and Binah adds, burn down Binah first, then Cochma.Phase 2This starts at around 60% health - be careful as you can fall off the platform during this phase.Stay in the center as best you can.Pillar of Mercy - fist strikes on the blue circles with knockback - stand next to them (not inside otherwise you take the dmg) on the inside of the arena to avoid being knocked off the platform.He puts individual markers on two players which look like giant beams of light. He will do a large cleave at these two. Various strategies can be applied, but easiest is just strafing to a side, having marked players go one way, and non-marked go the other way. Use of waypoints is recommended.Kill the Storm of Words add quickly, before it casts Revelation - if it casts Revelation you'll wipe. Once Storm of Words is dead, focus on killing the Binah/Cochma adds.It will drop an air current on death, when it's marked by arrows stand inside to avoid the arm sweep.After the arm sweep he will charge up a beam, spread out before restacking in the center.He will summon two large red pillars. One person needs to stand in each pillar to avoid raid damage (Tanks are a good choice for this.)Loot10Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsSephirot Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)Sephirot SapDrops directly from boss, must besyncedImagesTrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
