But even in an unforgiving environment such as this, life has endured. In a fierce struggle for what little aether yet remains, the Burn's beastly denizens have grown uncommonly savage, and you and your comrades must contend with their dangerous ilk as you scour its white sands.— In-game descriptionThe Burnis a level 70dungeonintroduced inpatch 4.4withStormblood.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Hedetet3.2Defective Drone3.3Mist Dragon4Loot4.1Hedetet4.2Defective Drone4.3Mist Dragon4.4Additional Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 12.1 Y: 13.1)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 11.4 Y: 10.7)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 9.0 Y: 7.3)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 5.3 Y: 5.1)4.4.4.1Miss List5Achievements6Images6.1Gear Images6.2Dungeon ImagesDuty SupportHienY'shtolaAlisaieYugiriClassSamuraiArchonRed MageNinjaRoleTankHealerDPSDPSObjectivesArrive in the Scorpion's Den: 0/1Clear the Scorpion's Den: 0/1Arrive in the Gamma Segregate: 0/1Clear the Gamma Segregate: 0/1Arrive in the Aspersory: 0/1Defeat themist dragon: 0/1BossesVideo guide by MTQcaptureHedetetTake note of the four white crystals jutting from the ground, as these serve as shields for some of the boss's attacks. Be warned that the crystals explode after being hit by one of Hedetet's attacks. New crystals fall from the ceiling, but be prepared to move out of their way.Crystal Needle:Tankbuster.Hailfire:Places a crosshair on a random target. After a short delay, Hedetet blasts sand at the targeted player, damaging the first thing it hits. Standing behind a crystal blocks all damage.All subsequent casts ofHailfirebegin with Hedetet jumping to a random spot in the arena before targeting a player.Shardfall:Arena-wide area of effect. Stand behind a crystal to protect yourself. Hedetet castsDissonanceimmediately after this attack.Dissonance:Another arena-wide area of effect. This time the safe zone is inside Hedetet's hitbox. Deals high damage and inflictsVulnerability Upif it connects.Shardstrike:Places an AoE marker on all players. Spread out to avoid damage overlap, but also position as to not hit any of the crystals.Defective DroneThe Defective Drone's arena is smaller than most, and the left and right sides of the arena are constantly burning, inflictingBurnsfor as long as the player stands in it. Additionally, take note of the "lanes" the arena is separated into.Aetherochemical Flame:High party-wide damage. Mitigate and heal through this.Aetherochemical Coil:Tankbuster that hits an arc in front of the boss.Prior to the next move, the Defective Drone will launch a glob of sludge towards a random player that inflictsLeadenwhile inside of it.Full Throttle:The Defective Drone moves out of the arena, showing up with five smallerMining Droneson one of the sides. Determine which of the smaller drones is sparking and does not have lights above it, and move into its lane. Getting run over by the drones inflicts massive damage and knockback guaranteed to push you into the fire.Rock Busters:Summons Rock Busters on the sides of the arena that launch across in a straight line after a short time. Simply don't stand in front of them.After a while, the boss summons aRepurposed Dreadnaughtthat has the standard Dreadnaught attacks.Mist DragonRime Wreath:High party-wide damage, mitigate and heal through this. The Mist Dragon will spam this attack when it isn't casting anything else.Frost Breath:Two distinct attacks cast one after another. The first attack targets a non-tank and damages everything in a line from the boss to the targeted player. The second marks the tank and hits a wide arc in the tank's direction. Several ice puddles appear in the areas the attacks hit. The attack itself inflicts a dispellableFrostbite, while the puddles also inflictFrostbitefor as long as a player stands in them.Fog Plume:Star area of effect attack on a random target. After the initial attack hits, four arena-wide line AoEs originating from the first attack's landing point will appear. Later on in the fight, the Mist Dragon will target two players with this ability. In addition to taking damage, the attack traps those hit by it in blocks of ice calledMist. The Mist prevents movement, but can be attacked by other players to free those trapped inside.Vaporize:The Mist Dragon turns into mist in the center of the arena. ThreeDraconic Regardadds will spawn and tether to the Mist Dragon.Attempting to attack the Mist Dragon in this form will cause it to counterattack, freezing the offending player in Mist.Cold Fog:An area of effect centered on the Mist Dragon's misty form that gradually expands. Slaying all of theDraconic Regardadds will prevent the attack's area from expanding further.Deep Fog:The arena becomes shrouded in thick fog that gives an indefiniteDropsydebuff, and the Mist Dragon leaves the arena. The Mist Dragon will spray a wide line through the center of the arena with ice, dealing high damage and freezing anyone caught in it. The boss will swoop twice before the fog disperses. Players should run around the edge of the arena until they see the orange AoE indicators, which will appear when they are close enough. This will allow them to dodge the AoEs without having to guess.Touchdown:A proximity marker will appear on the ground, indicating where the Mist Dragon is about to slam down. Free anyone still trapped in Mist and move as quickly as you can to the opposite side of the arena.LootSee also:Royal Volunteer's ArmorandRoyal Volunteer's AccessoriesHedetet15Allagan Tomestone of
