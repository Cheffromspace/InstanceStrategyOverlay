Since then, the fortress has only fallen further into disrepair, and her garrison has long since been presumed dead. Unlike most Ishgardians, who would sooner put the tragic episode behind them, Father Wealdtheow would have you enter the forsaken fortress and reclaim a priceless treasure: an ice rondel set in the crown of a sculpture within the vigil's chapel.

this─if there is anyone left to read it─let it be known that I, Ser Pascaleret Neurtaille, bore witness to Dalamud's fall. The lesser moon's descent, the black doom which emerged from within, the flames which spread across the horizon, turning night to day─it shall haunt me for the rest of my days.It is the dawn of the “Seventh Umbral Era,” according to some of the men. I told them to put no stock in the ravings of the prophetess, but even I do not know what to believe anymore.— Torn Journal PageTorn Journal Page 2“The engineers are still surveying the damage, but anyone with eyes can tell that the Dusk Vigil is beyond repair. Some walls are hardly fit to be called as such, piles of crumbling masonry as they are.The officers have been pleading with Ser Yuhelmeric, asking him to order a withdrawal. He knows our position is untenable, yet he refuses. “We will hold it to the last, for we are the shields on the wall─the defenders of the Holy See,” he says. He is a brave, pious man. Less so, we who serve under him.— Torn Journal PageTorn Journal Page 3“The men we rescued from the collapsed wing have not fared well. Given our dwindling supplies and this seemingly endless blizzard, we may be forced to make difficult decisions soon.This unseasonable weather grows worse with every passing day, and the toll it has taken on morale is plain. We have yet to receive reinforcements from the Holy See, and I fear none shall come.Nevertheless, Ser Yuhelmeric remains steadfast in his decision and will suffer no talk of withdrawal.
Ser Yuhelmeric's steward tells me he passes hours in the chapel, praying to the Fury for guidance... But I chanced to see him once, as he knelt before the statue. His eyes were transfixed upon the jewel in its helm, and he was whispering things I dare not write.— Torn Journal PageTorn Journal Page 4“Ser Yuhelmeric has taken me into his confidence. He says I am an honest man. I wish I were a braver one.The mutiny has been quelled. Among the starving, half-mad knights were Ser Yuhelmeric's most trusted officers. He wielded the axe himself.Ser Yuhelmeric received me in the chapel afterwards. I told him we will not last a fortnight without food. He smiled and told me that the Fury has blessed us with a bounty of fresh meat, then returned to his prayers. I joined him.— Torn Journal PageTorn Journal Page 5“O Halone, pray forgive Your humble servant. For too long have I let fear rule my heart, and in my cowardice have I been party to unspeakable acts.I know now I shall never see my children again─nor would I want them to look upon their father's face...and what it has become.I am outside Her grace.— Torn Journal PageSer Yuhelmeric's ResolveCounterpart to the Dawn Vigil in the east, this watchtower served as Ishgard's shield against the Dravanian Horde in the west. Garrisoned by the brave knights of House Durendaire, for long years the Dusk Vigil stood firm against the enemy, but it was brought to its knees by the Calamity, which wrought extensive damage to the structure before ushering in a bitter freeze, encasing it in ice. According to a knight’s account as writ in a recovered journal, those engineers who surveyed the watchtower’s crumbling walls pled with their commander, Ser Yuhelmeric, asking him to order a withdrawal, but the man would not hear of it. Heedless of the extreme cold, he was determined to discharge his duty to the last and refused to abandon the Vigil, holding his ground even when the garrison’s supplies dwindled with no prospect of aid from the Holy See. Many men died—first of the cold, then of starvation, then in a bloody, failed mutiny. Of what followed, little is known, but the Dusk Vigil has since come to be inhabited by all manner of fell beasts, and gods only know what else.Ser YuhelmericA knight of House Durendaire, Ser Yuhelmeric commanded the garrison at the Dusk Vigil. Unin-terred upon his death, he rose again as a revenant to haunt the watchtower he once defended. He left behind in Ishgard a loving wife, who to this day awaits his return.OpinicusAfter the Dusk Vigil fell into disuse, this imposing griffin claimed it for its domain. The creature has adapted remarkably well to the cold that descended upon Coerthas, lying in wait for prey that enters the watchtower in search of shelter.MoreA sculpture of Halone, the Fury, is consecrated at Saint Guenriol’s Chapel deep inside the Dusk Vigil, within whose helm is set a priceless sapphire known as an ice rondel. Desiring to retrieve this treasure, a memento of his son Yuhelmeric, Father Wealdtheow drew upon his personal funds to recruit an adventurer to brave the dangers within the watchtower.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
