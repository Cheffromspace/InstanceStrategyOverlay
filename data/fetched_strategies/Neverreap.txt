Already facing an upwind battle to shelter his people from the warlike Vundu, his mask─the traditional symbol of power in Vanu Vanu society─has grown old and worn. Should it crack, and his authority with it, the peaceful tribe would be powerless to stave off the coming storm. Venture into Neverreap─the sacred isle of the Vanu Vanu that has been overrun by the Vundu and the vicious beasts in their thrall─and emerge with the scale of a mighty waukkeon, that the sun might shine on the Zundu once more!— In-game descriptionNeverreapis a level 60dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.0withHeavensward.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Nunyenunc2.2Canu Vanu2.3Waukkeon3Loot3.1Nunyenunc3.2Canu Vanu3.3Waukkeon3.4Additional Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 14.3 Y: 14.3)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 12.9 Y: 12.9)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 14.3 Y: 9.2)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 14.0 Y: 6.4)4Achievements5Images5.1Gear Images5.2Dungeon Images6Lore6.1Canu Vanu6.2The Waukkeon6.3More7DialogueObjectivesArrive at the God who Whispers: 0/1Arrive at the Wind that Summons: 0/1Arrive at the Cloud that Laughs: 0/1BossesNeverreap GuideNunyenuncAvoidFeather SquallAoE.Boss will disappear and area will be covered in mist, players must run around the edge to findNunyenunc's Shadowand kill it.Kill Nunyeninc's Feathers ASAP, they will explode dealing damage and inflictVulnerability Up.Canu VanuMorrowcloudtargets random player and inflicts Bleed, healer needs to cleanse this.Sacred Totemmarks players, they will drop a totem in their place, a few seconds later, he will castTotem Chant, a big purple circle will spawn in a random place, any Totems need to be carried out of this circle before the cast finishes.

Vanu
Floating at the fringes of the Sea of Clouds, these isles are hallowed by the Vanu Vanu as the birthplace of Bismarck, whom they believe is the reincarnation of a noble white-hued whale whose soul was honored by the gods. Legend holds that the northernmost isle was the very first landmass the Lord of the Mists raised from the sea unto the sky, in recognition of which a shrine, the Cloud That Laughs, was built upon it.Since ancient times, it has been forbidden to harvest the bounty of Neverreap—even to set foot upon it save during an annual ritual is a grievous offense. Indeed, the isles’ name, a direct translation of the Vanu, alludes to this fact. Students of language may be interested to know that pronouncing the native name requires a sound made by plucking the inside of the beak with one’s tongue—a difficult feat for other races. And so, for this and certain other Vanu names, common Eorzean has come to be used.Canu VanuA shaman of the powerful and warlike Vundu, Canu Vanu leads a radical faction within his tribe. Believing that the symbol of power among the Vanu Vanu. In a bid to Bismarck’s blessing places him above Vanu law, he knows no scruple and has made countless transgressions, among them the profaning of ancestral totems, which he cursed and reduced to tools of war.The WaukkeonMaking its nest on Neverreap, the scales of this giant sanuwa glisten with liquid vibrancy, as if the life-giving rains that fall upon the floating isles were trapped within.
From such a treasure one might fashion the finest of masks, the symbol of power among the Vanu Vanu. In a bid to undermine the Zundu chieftain’s authority and prevent him from replacing his aging mask, the Vundu would go so far as to trespass upon forbidden ground in order to hunt the creature.MoreErected along the paths of Neverreap are arcane apparatuses known as cloud altars. By making an offering of prayer and dance to Bismarck at these altars, pilgrims are blessed with a gust that bears them ever closer to His shrine, the Cloud That Laughs.Dialogue(Optional)Tonu Vanu:I welcome you to Neverreap, brave netherling. Take thunder eggs in hand. Place thunder eggs on an altar of the clouds, and winds will swirl and carry you deeper into Neverreap. But be warned, for there great dangers await.Canu Vanu:A netherling dares defile our sacred isle?
You will suffer the storm of Canu Vanu's divine justice!Canu Vanu:Yes, the totems!
Stir to life, they do, at Canu Vanu's command!Canu Vanu:Come, my totems!
