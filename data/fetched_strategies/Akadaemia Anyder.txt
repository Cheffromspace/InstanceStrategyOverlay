Within its hallowed halls, the star's ancient overseers toil to perfect the godlike art of creation magicks, their research and experiments bringing into existence myriad forms of fantastical life. Yet even if these creations be naught but reflections of reality─mere phantasms woven from aether─the techniques which engender such miracles are a source of undeniable power. Step now across the threshold, and behold the glories of a civilization lost to the ages.— In-game descriptionAkadaemia Anyderis a level 80dungeonintroduced inpatch 5.0withShadowbringers.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Cladoselache and Doliodus2.1.1Cladoselache2.1.2Doliodus2.2Marquis Morbol2.3Guardian Force: Quetzalcoatl3Loot3.1Cladoselache & Doliodus3.2Marquis Morbol3.3Guardian Force: Quetzalcoatl3.4Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 5.1 Y: 12.5)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 6.0 Y: 11.9)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 9.9 Y: 8.6)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 10.6 Y: 6.6)4Lore5Achievements6Images6.1Gear Images6.2Dungeon ImagesObjectivesArrive in Ichthyology: 0/1Clear Ichthyology: 0/1Arrive in Phytobiology: 0/1Clear Phytobiology: 0/1Arrive in Phantomology: 0/1DefeatQuetzalcoatl: 0/1BossesVideo guide by MTQcaptureCladoselacheandDoliodusCladoselacheProtolithic Puncture:Tankbuster.Tidal Guillotine: Area of Effect attack centred around Cladoselache.

It is here that many ichthyologists seek to follow in Mitron's footsteps, and engender sea creatures characterized by traits both unique and beneficial."Diversity is the key to a robust star. The ocean is the soup of life, and we must endeavor to enhance its richness."Such were the words of Mitron, and they guide our research to this day.— Akadaemia Anyder Visitor's Guide“Did you know that the original Halmarut, a man lauded for countless advancements in the field of phytobiology, was an avid landscape gardener? He was famed for botanical labyrinths of intricate design, the foliage of which he sought to protect from voracious pests with the inventive application of creation magicks-a recreational project said to have led to the evolution of the world's first carnivorous plants.Students of his research later expanded upon those early techniques, and successfully developed an extended family of ambulatory flora. If you, too, wish to set down roots in this fertile field of study, hearken you to the Words of Halmarut and submit your application to the Akadaemia.— Akadaemia Anyder Visitor's Guide“The instances of spontaneous creation occurring in the lands across the ocean are now a confirmed phenomenon. Seemingly unguided by conscious will, these aberrations are said to manifest as malformed "beasts" of nightmarish aspect and unrestrained ferocity.High-ranking phantomologists have since been dispatched to afflicted areas, where they conducted the capture and transport of a single entity. This specimen, characterized by a disproportionately large maw, was dubbed "Archaeotania," and investigations into its aetheric composition are ongoing.A theory posited by the esteemed Lahabrea suggests that the shape these fiendish beings assume is not random, but rather an amalgamation of the fears which lurk beneath our rational minds. As of this writing, researchers have begun pursuing methods by which potent guardians of deliberate design might be engendered to stand against this mounting threat.— Akadaemia Anyder Research ReportAchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Akadaemia Anyder10Discover every location withinAkadaemia Anyder.-5.0ImagesGear ImagesDungeon ImagesDungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
