Those who want for resilience may yet be pulled up by a friend's helping hand, but what becomes of a brokenhearted maiden who has neither the strength nor the succor to overcome the darkness that threatens to consume her?

Just hold onto the boss and keep her attention. The gimmick is all on the DPS/Healer. A horde of zombies will be summoned and start chasing one of the players other than the tank.DO NOT ATTACK THEM, kite them. At some point, she will put an orange/red arrow-like mark over someone's head (again, not the tank). That person needs to run into the horde. This unleashes an AoE that will kill the zombies for you. If you kill a zombie yourself, the party takes a huge damage resistance debuff that lasts one minute and stacks up to 8 times. If you don't make the boss kill the zombies with her AoE on the first two attempts, you will take the debuff from the remaining zombies a few seconds later after she does her next attack. Go all out on damage during the breaks between hordes.Do not attack the adds. The person with the red arrow mark should go to the person being attacked by the adds.Players should group up in the middle so the player targeted by the adds will always be next to the player marked by the arrowSpare BodyThe friendly NPC,Paiyo Reiyo, is trapped in the middle and you must protect him. The boss has a lot of HP so this can take a while. The key is to stop the NPC in the middle from taking any damage. Any time he takes damage the boss will grow bigger and stronger. If he dies, the boss does a full party wipe attack. At various points during the fight purple balls of energy will come out of the portals and head towards the NPC. You need to have everyone run through them to prematurely detonate them to protect the NPC. Later, there will be two larger balls instead of the bunch of smaller ones. They seem to move slow enough so just knock them out. The boss also has an AoE attack that will leave a danger zone on the floor that causesBleeddamage-over-time. I was able to keep it on the edge of the map but really be careful not to let the NPC get hit by it.Intercept the orbs spawned by the portals at the edge of the boss room. Do not let the orbs reach the center of the room!Avere BravearmEdda stands in the middle of the room in a circle that causesBleeding. She cannot be targeted and will periodically summon demons outside the arena to execute linear aoe attacks which all seem to converge on the tank.Avere Bravearm, while the boss, does not have any notable abilities himself.At certain points during the battle a bunch of crawling zombies similar to the Siren fight will appear from the edges and make their way towards the center of the room. If any of them reach the circle, a rune on the floor will light up. The more runes light up, the stronger the boss's "Red Wedding" attack will hit at the end of this.Do not let crawling zombie adds reach the center of the room. They will spawn at the edge, kill them ASAP!LootSee also:Ilvl 80 Dungeon ArmorandIlvl 80 Dungeon AccessoriesLiavinne10Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBoots of the Divine

Tam-Tara Deepcroft (Hard).-2.3ImagesGear ImagesDungeon ImagesMapLoreTorn Folio 1“I finally mustered the courage to speak with your hero, my love. <Forename> is as kind and wise as s/he is brave and strong. S/He listened attentively as I told him all about you─about us.Though s/he is a wo/man of few words, or perhaps because s/he is, everything s/he said seemed to inspire me. Why, his/her gaze alone instilled me with a confidence I never knew I had. Truly, I feel better prepared to face the future for having met him/her. How right you were, my love.— Torn FolioTorn Folio 2“I could not have hoped for a more romantic first visit to Mor Dhona. The crystals that pierce the landscape glowed in all their majesty, as if to celebrate our future together. And as we lazed by Silvertear Lake, watching the waves lapping at the shore, the sun took its leave behind the horizon, that we might enjoy a moment of intimacy.“I want us to be together forever.” You first said these words to me years ago, and you said them to me again tonight. I am so happy to be with you.— Torn FolioTorn Folio 3“You have been looking deathly pale of late. The scorching heat of Thanalan does not agree with you. You were never fond of hot climes, and it was a mistake to come here. Let us make for Coerthas, where the bracing air will put roses on your cheeks.— Torn FolioTorn Folio 4“I know, I know─it is not easy being without a body. I promise to find one for you, but you must have patience. You are my husband-to-be, and there is nothing I would not do for you, so please, have faith in me. Give me time, my love, and I shall make you whole again, as you make me.— Torn FolioTorn Folio 5“I am sorry to keep you waiting, my love, but we cannot afford to compromise─not where your new body is concerned. Ordinary adventurers die often enough, leaving their ordinary corpses, but if you are to be like <Forename>, we cannot settle for anything less than extraordinary.But a strong body requires an equally strong soul─as I recently discovered. Now, you are probably worried that strong souls are rare, and so they are─but never fear, for we can create one ourselves! All we need is a plentiful supply of the weaker kind, and they are common indeed. Be patient just a little longer, my love, and all will be as you desire.— Torn FolioTorn Folio 6“With the nigh-endless supply of bodies here, I will make you well again, my love. Then we shall be wed as man and wife, and forever be joined as the gods intended. Of course, it is only fitting that a proper ceremony be held, with guests in attendance. I will send out invitations to all our friends. They will be so happy for us, I have no doubt they will jump at the chance to part with their souls.— Torn FolioTriviaReddit User Pacoeltaco's guide to Tam-Tara HM's storyline(Warning: Spoilers).DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
