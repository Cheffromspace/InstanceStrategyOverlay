They believe the layer of grime covering the seedkin has invigorating properties that could be used to revitalize the soil of Greengrub Mudplots. Unfortunately, hordes of aggressive plant life exposed to the substance stand between them and the information they seek. You agree to lead an expedition into the Arboretum to clear a path and thereby allow safe passage to its inner reaches.— In-game descriptionSaint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)is a level 70dungeonintroduced inpatch 4.4withStormblood.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Nullchu2.2Lakhamu2.3Tokkapchi3Loot3.1Nullchu3.2Lakhamu3.3Tokkapchi3.4Additional Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 9.9 Y: 9.7)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 11.4 Y: 9.1)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 14.9 Y: 6.9)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 17.0 Y: 5.6)3.4.4.1Miss List4Achievements5Images5.1Gear Images5.2Dungeon ImagesObjectivesArrive in Zymology: 0/1Clear Zymology: 0/1Arrive in the Soil Bed: 0/1Clear the Soil Bed: 0/1Arrive in Kingsloam: 0/1DefeatTokkapchi: 0/1BossesVideo guide by MTQcaptureNullchuOdious Air:A cone that deals damage and inflictsPoison.Vine Whip:Tankbuster.Fault Warren:Stack marker on a random player.Every so often, a non-targetable Rafflesia add will spawn on the edge of the arena with a notification of "The hall echoes with the twitching of roots and vines". It will target two random players with markers that create poisonous pools that inflictLeadenwhile the players stand in them.Devour:The Nullchu will leap to the Rafflesia's position and consume it. It will then turn towards the center of the arena and breathe poison, which deals damage every second a player stands in it and also inflictsPoison. The best way to avoid this is to stand near the Rafflesia, as the poison breath casts extremely quickly. Nullchu telegraphs this attack by turning to face the Rafflesia, with a notification of "The Nullchu has found its next meal!"Taproot:All players are targeted with AoEs, spread out to avoid overlapping damage.LakhamuWhen the fight begins, the edges of the arena will be coated in thorny vines, damaging players who come in contact with them as well as inflicting a stack ofVulnerability Up.Stone II:Tankbuster.Tectonics:Party-wide damage.Landslip:The arena is covered in four "conveyor belt" line markers, and a fewSilt Golemadds will spawn on the outside of the arena. When the cast completes, all players will be pushed in the direction of the arrows a distance roughly equivalent to half the arena. As players are being pushed, the Silt Golems will castRockslide, damaging in a line ahead of them and inflictingVulnerability Up.Players should do their best to be pushed into a safe area, as there's little time to avoid Rockslide after being pushed.Earthquake:Melee-range area of effect followed immediately by a ring area of effect. Move to melee range or far range to dodge.Earth Shaker:Marks the two DPS players, dealing damage in a line from the boss to the player.Empty Gaze:Gaze attack that inflictsHysteria.TokkapchiThe arena for this fight is a grate with four solid platforms. Periodically, the mud beneath the platform will churn with the message "The puddles begin to froth". After a short delay, mud will explode upwards through the grate, damaging players not on a solid platform and launching them into the air.Mudsling:Tankbuster.Quagmire:All players are marked for an AoE. Spread out to avoid overlap, but also keep the center of the attack off the solid platforms. Allowing Quagmire to coat a platform creates a highly-damaging puddle on that platform.Mud Pie:Tokkapchi will move to the center of the arena and create aMud Slimeadd. The add cannot be killed, only pushed via damage.Keep all of the boss's area of effect attacks away from the Mud Slime, including the periodic puddle explosion.Allowing the Mud Slime to be hit with attacks will cause it to grow, causing it to deal more damage when it finally detonates.After roughly 45 seconds, the Mud Slime will castCorrupture, dealing damage to the entire party based on how large it became. If the Mud Slime was not allowed to grow at all, Corrupture instead only hits melee range. If the Mud Slime grows once, Corrupture will deal moderate party-wide damage. If the Mud Slime grows twice, it will explode immediately for very high damage while also inflictingDamage Down.Royal Flush:Melee-range area of effect.During the second cast ofMud Pie, twoMuddy Dorpokkuradds will spawn. These adds have low HP and mainly serve as a distraction from the newly-created Mud Slime.Feculent Flood:Cone attack targeting the Mud Slime. Very long cast time to allow the players to push the Mud Slime away.Bog Bequest:Ring area of effect that leaves melee range safe. If Tokkapchi is on the edge of the arena, the opposite side is also a safe area.LootSee also:Royal Volunteer's ArmorandRoyal Volunteer's AccessoriesNullchu15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem
