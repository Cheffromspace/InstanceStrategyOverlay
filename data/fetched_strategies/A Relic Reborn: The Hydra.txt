Some have prospered more than others in the abattoir gloom; the hydra reposes fat and malignant, an apt pupil for your yet unfinished relic. Seek out this foul orphan of the Calamity, and let the bards sing of it.— In-game descriptionA Relic Reborn: The Hydrais a level 50trialintroduced inpatch 2.16.StrategyHydraAbilitiesDisseveris an instant attack that deals a small amount of damage.Triumvirateis an frontal attack that deals a massive amount of damage.
