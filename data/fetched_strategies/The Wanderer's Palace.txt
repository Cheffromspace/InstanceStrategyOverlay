Thought to have been built by the Nymian Civilization, which thrived in the area some fifteen centuries ago, the palace appears to have been dedicated to their patron deity, Oschon, the Wanderer.In search of the bounty she may hold, adventurers delved into this forsaken place to find it populated by green-skinned fiends the likes of which none had ever seen. Known as tonberries, the creatures were revealed to be citizens of Nym who fell victim to a disfiguring plague—part of a cruel Mhachi plot that unleashed upon them the pestilence-carrying voidsent, Bitoso. As the Fifth Astral Era neared its end, those afflicted were isolated within the Wanderer's Palace, but with no cure in sight and panic gripping the nation, Nymian mages swelled the land’s waters, drowning the temple and sealing all of its inhabitants within.Tonberry KingThe leader of the tonberries, his crimson garb identifies him as a former high mage of Nym. His unbridled rage towards those who imprisoned them at the bottom of the lake transformed him into the embodiment of rancor—a rancor that was amplified by his arcane affinity and consumed all of his kin, leaving them mindless vessels of vengeance.Mamool Ja OccupationBound no more by the rancor of their fallen king, the tonberries slowly began to regain their senses—with a little help from devoted friends such as the scholar Surito Carito.Yet all thoughts of peace were soon put to the blade, as a band of Mamool Ja mercenaries hailing from the New World stormed the walls of the Wanderer’s Palace and seized the temple for their own. Calling themselves the Silverscales, these unscrupulous sellswords saw the tonberries as little more than a source of labor and forced the hapless creatures into slavery. It would fall to righteous adventurers to vanquish these interlopers from afar and liberate their thralls.Manxome Molaa Ja JaBoth leader and second-in-command of the Silverscales, Mola Ja Ja was born of an inter-tribal marriage, a union which occasionally results in two-headed offspring. Known as "blessed siblings," these individuals are groomed for leadership from birth indeed, Molaa Ja Ja's purpose for crossing the sea to Eorzea was to win glory and strengthen his claim to the throne of the Aurarch, ruler of all Mamool Ja. Upon arriving, however, he struggled to find employment for his warband and in a bid to make a name in this foreign land, he took the drastic step of capturing a piece of it.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
