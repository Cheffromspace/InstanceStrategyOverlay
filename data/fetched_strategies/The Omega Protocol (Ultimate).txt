Best-in-slot sets for each job are provided byThe Balance(see its Discord server for the most up-to-date sets). These consist primarily ofAbyssos Armor/Accessories,Augmented Lunar Envoy's Armor/Accessories, andVoidmoon Armor/Accessories.GuideVisual guide by Tessan TwintailsAll throughout this battle, the arena will be surrounded by a border that will kill any player who touches it.Failing mechanics or being hit by avoidable AoEs is usually lethal, although tanks may survive. However, they will be inflicted with a crippling -90%Damage Downdebuff that lasts for 3 minutes. If the player does not need to be immediately alive for a mechanic, they should incapacitate themself by walking into the wall and then be resurrected to remove the Damage Down, as theWeaknessdebuff is only around a 25% damage loss that lasts for half the time.Phase 1:OmegaProgram Loop: Assigns various debuffs to players.All players will be givenLooperwith various timers (16, 25, 34, or 43 seconds). For ease of identification, each Looper timer will be denoted with aFirst/Second/Third/Fourth in Linedebuff. Two random players will each receive a given debuff timer. Players must cleanse this debuff by soaking a yellow tower, which will also deal moderate damage (Storage Violation) and inflict a stack ofTwice-come Ruin. If this reaches two stacks (i.e., the player is is hit by another mechanic until it wears off) it will inflictDoom, killing them. Failing to cleanseLooperbefore the timer expires will inflict the player withMemory Loss, causing them to uncontrollably walk into the death wall.Four sets of two towers each will sequentially spawn. Towers will always spawn 90 or 180 degrees from each other between the intercardinals. Players must soak these towers in the order of theirLooper / In Linedebuffs or the tower will explode and wipe the raid (Storage Violation Obliteration). Players who do not haveLooperare unable to soak towers.The boss will also tether two random players at the start of the mechanic. These tethers can be passed between players. It will useBlasterfour times in a row, hitting the currently tethered players with a massive circular AoE that inflictsHP Penaltydebuff that decreases their maximum HP by 99% for the debuff duration and inflicts a stack ofTwice-come Ruin.To prevent deaths from overlapping mechanic damage and excess stacks of Twice-come Ruin, these tethers should be grabbed in the order of 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 based on theIn Linedebuffs. Players who get the tethers must move away from the towers that are about be soaked. Players who are not currently soaking towers should stand near them to dodge theBlasterAoEs. Players whose HP Penalty debuffs fall off and are about to soak a tower will need to be healed, or they will die from the soak damage.Pantokrator: Assigns various debuffs to players.All players will be givenGuided Missile Kyrios Incomingwith various timers andCondensed Wave Cannon Kyrios, both with various timers (12, 18, 24, or 30 seconds). For ease of identification, eachGuided Missile Kyrios Incomingtimer will be denoted with aFirst/Second/Third/Fourth in Linedebuff. Two random players will each receive a given Missile debuff timer, which also determines their Wave Cannon timer. When the debuff expires, the player will be hit with a medium-sized circle AoE (Guided Missile Kyrios) that deals moderate damage, inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, and knocks back and kills anyone else caught in the AoE, requiring the player to be isolated when the debuff expires.WhenCondensed Wave Cannon Kyriosexpires, the player will be targeted with a heavy-hitting line AoE that must be split among three players to prevent lethal damage. This also inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up.The boss will telegraph two opposite, conal AoEs (Flamethrower), each covering a sixth of the room, that will rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise. Note that it is not possible to determine the rotation until the AoEs start rotating (which will all have orange indicators).During this mechanic, telegraphed circular AoEs (Ballistic Missile) will periodically appear at each player's position.The party must split into two groups of four players, each having four differentIn Linedebuffs. Each group will rotate to dodge the conal and circular AoEs while remaining stacked to soak Condensed Wave Cannon Kyrios. Heavy mitigation and healing are required. Players whose Missile debuffs are about to expire must leave the stack and soak their missile alone to prevent killing others, while avoiding the concurrent Wave Cannon. They must then return to the stack.When all debuffs resolve, the boss will target the two furthest players with five-hit, massive tankbuster cleaves (Diffuse Wave Cannon Kyrios). In addition, three non-tanks will be marked with an orange marker, indicating they will bait a line AoE (Wave Cannon Kyrios) that deals damage and inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up. After these resolve, the remaining three non-tanks will be marked and must bait the AoEs. Both tanks can stack on each other at max melee range in front of the boss and use their invulnerability cooldowns, while the rest of the party spreads and stays in fixed positions along the flanks and rear.Atomic Ray:Enrage.The boss must be defeated before this short cast finishes or the party will wipe.Phase 2:Omega-MandOmega-FFirewall: causes Omega-M and Omega-F to inflictPacket Filter ForPacket Filter Monto each player, rendering them incapable of damaging the other Omega form for as long as the debuff persists. Each boss will inflict their debuff on the four closest players to it, allowing the party to preposition. It is not possible for one player to have both debuffs at once.Solar Ray: Each boss will hit their highest enmity player with a heavy-hitting, telegraphed AoE tankbuster.Party Synergy: Assigns all players with eitherMid GlitchorRemote Glitch, both of which tether random pairs of players together. All players will receive the same debuff. Both debuffs require paired players to be of a certain distance from each other, or they will be inflicted withVulnerability Up, when the distance is not correct, making any damage taken lethal.Mid Glitchrequires the tether to be of a moderate length (around half of the arena).Remote Glitchrequires the tether to be fully stretched out (around the diameter of the arena). Each member of a pair will also be given an overhead marker (red circle, blue X, green triangle, purple square) for easy identification and positioning for upcoming mechanics. The symbols will disappear after several seconds. The bosses will become untargetable and begin a series of mechanics:Several clones ofOmega-MandOmega-Fwill appear in fixed patterns. These will telegraph certain AoEs based on their stance. Players will need to quickly identify and dodge into the safe spots, as the orange AoE indicators will very briefly appear.AnOmega-MandOmega-Fclone will always be directly opposite from each other with a third clone in line in the middle. The clones at the ends of this line will attack first.If theOmega-Mclone has ashield, it will useBeyond Strength, a donut AoE.If theOmega-Mclone has asword, it will useEfficient Bladework, a point-blank AoE.If theOmega-Fclone hasbladed legs, it will useSuperliminal Steel, which hits the sides of the clone, leaving the middle safe.If theOmega-Fclone has astaff, it will useOptimized Blizzard III, a cross AoE through where it is facing, leaving her relative intercardinals safe..After dodging these AoEs, players will need to identify the large eye at the edge of the arena, which spawns at a random cardinal or intercardinal.This eye will do a massive line AoE (Optical Laser) through the middle of the arena, requiring the party to split into two groups of four players at the edges.Each player will be hit withOptimized Fire III, a large circle AoE that requires the party to be fully spread to the two safe spots at the sides of the eye. Players must also satisfy theirGlitchdistance requirement to prevent lethal damage. Note that if a player is dead when the AoEs resolve, a random player will receive two AoEs, killing them.IfMid Glitchis active, each pair must position so their tether is perpendicular to the eye line AoE and not fully stretch it out, i.e. they must be close to the line AoE but not directly next to it.IfRemote Glitchis active, each pair must be opposite from each other as far as possible. The two pairs closest and furthest from the eye must stretch their tether through the center point, while the two middle pairs can go to the wall and have their tether perpendicular to the eye line AoE. Alternatively, all pairs can stretch their tether through the center point.Afterwards, two random players will be given a stack marker (Spotlight), while anOmega-Fclone will castDischarger, a knockback from the middle. Five clones close to the edges will each use a point-blank AoE (Efficient Bladework), leaving three small safe spots that are 90 degrees from each other. Three clones will be directly adjacent (45 degrees) to each other, which can be used to orient to the safe spots. The party must again correctly split into two groups of four and be knocked back to different safe spots that satisfy theGlitchdistance requirement to prevent lethal damage from the stack AoE.IfMid Glitchis active, the light parties must be knocked back to adjacent safe spots (90 degrees apart).IfRemote Glitchis active, the light parties must be knocked back to opposite safe spots (180 degrees apart).TheGlitchdebuffs will expire, concluding the mechanic.Synthetic Shield:Omega-Mcasts this, equipping a shield in preparation for the next mechanic.Limitless Synergy: A series of mechanics from untargetableOmega-MandOmega-Fclones that conclude the phase.Omega-Fwill move to the north of the arena and begin a long cast ofLaser Shower, which will wipe the party if she is not defeated before this cast finishes.Omega-Mwill remain in the middle and makeOmega-Finvulnerable. He must be defeated first. The party will lose thePacket Filterdebuffs, so everyone should focus onOmega-M.AnOmega-Mclone will target a random party member withOptimized Sagittarius Arrow, a telegraphed line AoE. The party should stack to bait this, then dodge.AnOmega-MandOmega-Fclone will tether two random players. These tethers must be picked up by the tanks, who will be hit withOptimized Bladedance, a massive conal tankbuster that requires heavy mitigation and inflictsPhysical Vulnerability Up. These must be baited away from the party, who will be dodgingOptimized Sagittarius Arrow.AnOmega-Fclone will mark 3 random players with flare markers andPrey, who will be hit withOptimized Meteor, a proximity AoE. These players can move away from the center to lower the proximity damage. Alternatively, with heavy mitigation, they can stack together near the middle.TheOmega-Mclone with ashieldwill useBeyond Defenseon either the closet or second-closest player, a medium-sized AoE that inflicts a stack ofTwice-come Ruin. The tanks should be close to this clone to bait this. They must also spread, because any other player hit except for the primary target will be knocked into the wall and killed.The sameOmega-Mclone will then usePile Pitchon the closest player, a stack AoE that inflicts a stack ofTwice-come Ruin. The tank hit withBeyond Defensemust avoid baiting and stay out of the stack, or they will die. The tank not hit withBeyond Defenseshould stack with the party.Finally, anOmega-MandOmega-Fclone will useCosmo Memory, a heavy-hitting raidwide AoE that requires mitigation.The mechanics for this phase conclude here, so the party should focus on defeatingOmega-MthenOmega-Fbefore theLaser Showerenrage is allowed to finish casting.Intermission: ReconfigurationOmega reconfigures itself into a more powerful form, similar to the phase transition inAlphascape V4.0 (Savage). Unlike the original fight, the party must handle a brief mechanic during this transition.Four random players will receiveSniper Cannon Fodder(purple). When the debuff expires, the players will emit a medium-sized circular AoE that deals high damage and inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring them to be spread.Two random players will receiveHigh-powered Sniper Cannon Fodder(white). When the debuff expires, the players will emit a medium-sized circular AoE that deals high damage, inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, and must be split with one other player.The remaining two players will receive no debuff. Each will stack with a player inflicted withHigh-powered Sniper Cannon Fodder.A telegraphed circular AoE will appear in the middle, which will leave a puddle that will inflict a lethalBleedingdebuff. The initial AoE will also cascade outward as donut AoEs (Wave Repeater) twice, requiring players to dodge into the previously unsafe area. The puddle will disappear at the end of the mechanic.SixLeft/Right Arm Unitadds will spawn in two sets of three, 120 degrees from each other. These will telegraph a large circular AoE (Colossal Blow) in the order they spawned.To resolve this mechanic, the party will spread to areas between the first set ofArmsthat spawn, with each no-debuff player stacking with a white debuff player. Players will dodge the first set ofWave RepeaterAoEs while spread. Afterwards, they will position directly next to the AoE telegraphs from the first set ofArms. They will then move diagonally into the previously unsafe area to avoid the secondArmAoEs while dodging the secondWave RepeaterAoEs. During this dodge, the debuffs will resolve, so players should spread and stack as needed.Note that if a player with a debuff dies before their debuff expires, it will automatically detonate on another random player, likely resulting in more deaths.Phase 3: ReconfiguredOmegaHello, World: High raidwide damage that should be mitigated. Also assigns several debuffs to each player:All players receiveLocal Code Smellin four sets of timers, pairing random players. Player pairs whose timers will soon expire will be tethered with a semi-transparent red and green tether. When the debuff expires, it will turn intoLocal Regression. The tether will then become opaque. The tethered players must break the tether by moving close together, which will cause both players to emit a raidwide AoE (Patch) that deals damage and inflicts a stack ofMagic Vulnerability Upand a stack ofThrice-come Ruin, each lasting a second. Failing to break the tether in time will cause the players to explode and wipe the raid. Breaking more than one tether at once will also wipe the raid due to excess debuff stacks and damage.All players receiveRemote Code Smellin four sets of timers dependent on theLocaltimers. Player pairs whose timers will soon expire will be tethered with a semi-transparent blue tether. When the debuff expires, it will turn intoRemote Regression.  The tether will then become opaque. The tethered players must break the tether by moving apart, which will cause both players to emit a raidwide AoE (Patch) that deals damage and inflicts a stack ofMagic Vulnerability Upand a stack ofThrice-come Ruin, each lasting a second. Failing to break the tether in time will cause the players to explode and wipe the raid.All players receiveLatent Synchronization Bug. These debuffs must be cleansed by being hit with the stack AoE fromCritical Synchronization Bug. Failing to cleanse it will cause the player to explode and wipe the raid.Two random players receiveOverflow Code Smell. When the 2s debuff expires, it will turn intoCritical Overflow Bug(i.e., "defamation"). When this debuff expires, the player will emit a massive AoE that deals damage, inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, and transfers the debuff to all other players in range of the AoE. The originally debuffed player will also receiveOverflow Debugger, preventing them from receivingCritical Overflow Bugagain.Two random players receiveSynchronization Code Smell. When the 2s debuff expires, it will turn intoCritical Synchronization Bug(i.e., "stack"). When this debuff expires, the player will small AoE that deals damage, inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, and must be shared with one other person, which will also transfer the debuff to that person. The originally debuffed player will also receiveSynchronization Debugger, preventing them from receivingCritical Synchronization Bugagain.Either the two players withOverflow Code SmellorSynchronization Code Smellwill both receiveUnderflow Code Smell. When the 2s debuff expires, it will turn intoCritical Underflow Bug(i.e., "red rot"). Players with this debuff will be indicated with a red aura and overhead marker consisting of two cubes. Players withCritical Underflow Bugmust soak red puddles that spawn, or they will explode and wipe the raid.The other two players withOverflow Code SmellorSynchronization Code Smellwill both receivePerformance Code Smell. When the 2s debuff expires, it will turn intoCritical Performance Bug(i.e., "blue rot"). Players with this debuff will be indicated with a blue aura and overhead marker consisting of a diamond. Players withCritical Underflow Bugmust soak blue puddles that spawn, or they will explode and wipe the raid.If players with these debuffs contact another player without it, it will propagate the debuff to the new player. It is possible for a player to have both color-coded debuffs at once, although this is a failure state.Soaking a color-coded puddle will inflict eitherCascading Latent Defect(red) orLatent Performance Defect(blue). These debuffs can be cleansed by allowingCritical Underflow BugorCritical Performance Bugto expire, respectively. Failing to cleanse them will cause the players to explode and wipe the raid. This requires that the duration ofCritical Underflow BugorCritical Performance Bugis shorter than theDefects, i.e. players cannot wait too long to obtainUnderflow / Performance Bugsbefore soaking a puddle.WhenCritical Underflow BugorCritical Performance Bugexpire, the players will emit a medium-sized AoE that will kill anyone else caught in it, requiring them to be isolated. The players will also be inflicted withUnderflow DebuggerorPerformance Debugger, preventing them from receiving the respective color-coded debuffs again.Two random players not inflicted with the above debuffs will receiveLatent Defect.  They will always have the shortest durationLocal Code Smelltimer (23 seconds). These players must take damage before the debuff expires, or they will die.The remaining two players will not receive additional debuffs. They will always have the shortest durationRemote Code Smelltimer (23 seconds).The boss will castLatent Defectfour times in a row. Two red and two blue puddles will spawn 90 degrees from each other in a box pattern (with puddles of the same color always being directly adjacent), requiring players withCritical Underflow BugandCritical Performance Bugto soak red and blue puddles, respectively, before the cast bar finishes, or they will explode and wipe the raid.Essentially, there are four roles to handle in this mechanic. Pairs of players will each be randomly assigned a starting role based on their debuffs, which will determine their next role. All players will cycle through all four roles.Defamation: Players withCritical Overflow Bugwill each soak the puddles matching the color of theirRot, making sure to stand at max melee range to avoid hitting anyone with their AoE except for the players withLocal Code Smell(semi-transparent red and green tether) about to expire. They will then stand still and allow the players with the activeLocal Regressionto collect theirRot. They will then spread to avoid hitting anyone with theirRotexpiration AoE. Their next role will beBlue Tether.Blue Tether: Players withRemote Code Smellabout to expire will have a semi-transparent blue tether. They will each stand outside the puddles but next to the players withRotandCritical Synchronization Bugto take the stack AoE. After the puddles are soaked, they will move apart and obtain theRotfrom these players, which will also break theRemote Regressionblue tether. Their next role will beStack.Stack: Players withCritical Synchronization Bugwill each soak the puddles matching the color of theirRot, while standing next to the players withRemote Code Smellabout to expire for the stack AoE. They will then stand still and allow the players with the activeRemote Regressionto collect theirRot. They will then spread to avoid hitting anyone with theirRotexpiration AoE. Their next role will beRed and Green Tether.Red and Green Tether: Players withLocal Code Smellabout to expire will have a semi-transparent red and green tether. They will each stand outside the puddles that are being soaked by players withRotandCritical Overflow Bugto share the large "defamation" AoE, making sure to only be hit by one. After the puddles are soaked, they will obtain theRotfrom these players, then move together to break theLocal Regressionred and green tether. Their next role will beDefamation.In a given pull, only oneRotcolor will always be associated withDefamation, while the other color will always be associated withStack.During the fourth set of puddles, the remaining player pair withLocal Code Smell(red and green tether) will stack behind the blue tether players to avoid being hit byCritical Overflow Bug(defamation).The boss remains targetable during the mechanic and will auto-attack the main tank if not in a cast.During this mechanic, the party should use mitigation and healing actions appropriately due to the heavy incoming damage.Critical Error: High raidwide damage that should be mitigated. Also inflictsCritical Overflow Bugon anyone withoutOverflow Debugger. Because all players should have this debugger if they correctly resolvedHello World, no one should receiveCritical Overflow Bugunless if there were deaths.Oversampled Wave Cannon: Several blue monitors will appear on either the east or west side of the boss (which will always face north), while three random players receiveOversampled Wave Cannon Loading. These players will also be indicated with blue monitors on one side. When the cast bar fills, two random players on the side of the blue monitors from the boss or from the debuffed players will be hit with an AoE that deals damage and inflicts a stack ofTwice-come Ruin, making overlap lethal. The party must position and the debuffed players must face the correct direction to ensure that each player is only hit by one AoE.Note that if fewer than two players are to the side of a blue monitor, the respective blue monitors will target random players instead, likely resulting in deaths.Ion Efflux:Enrage.The boss must be defeated before this cast finishes or the party will wipe.Phase 4: DamagedOmegaOmega revives itself to full health (with a decreased max HP) but in a damaged condition, beginning a short mini-phase.Wave Cannon: Each player is targeted with a line AoE that inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring the party to be spread. A few seconds after the AoEs resolve, a follow-up line AoE that must be avoided will appear in each player's original location. Prior to the first line AoEs resolving, two random players will receive a line stack marker. The party must correctly split into two groups of four to take each stack while avoiding the follow-up line AoEs. Each stack inflicts heavy damage andMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring mitigation.This attack will be used three times in a row. TheWave Repeatercascading donut AoEs from the Intermission will also appear again, so the party must dodge these while handlingWave Cannon. Note that these AoEs are offset fromWave Cannon, so the dodge timing will change between the second and third line stacks.During the second set of line AoEs, the party should stay out of the hitbox and then dodge in to avoid the donut AoE after taking the individual line AoEs.During the third and final set of line stack AoEs, the party should take the stacks outside of the hitbox, then dodge in to avoid the donut AoE.Blue Screen:Enrage.The boss must be reduced to less than 20% health before this cast finishes or the party will wipe. If the party meets the DPS check, it will do high raidwide damage instead, requiring mitigation. It will also remove allDebuggerbuffs from the party.Phase 5: DynamisOmega-MandOmega-FOnlyOmega-Mis targetable at the start of the phase. This phase consists of "trio"-style mechanics in which the boss is untargetable, while the party focuses on handling combinations of mechanics fromBeetle Omega,Omega-M,Omega-F, andReconfigured Omega, using attacks previously seen in this encounter and in the original Savage fights. Note:Beetle OmegaandReconfigured Omegaare both referred to asOmegain game, but are named as such in this page for clarity.The primary goal of this phase is to obtain stacks ofQuickening Dynamis, which is obtained from two new debuffs:Hello, Near WorldandHello, Distant World, which are used repeatedly in the major mechanics. Each player must obtain 3 stacks ofQuickening Dynamisin order to progress through the final phase.WhenHello, Near Worldexpires, the target player will emit a large AoE. It will then "bounce" to the closest player to them, who will be hit with a medium-sized AoE. It will "bounce" again to the closest player from the second target, who will also be hit with a medium-sized AoE. Anyone except for the intended targets of the AoEs who are caught in them will die, which will also cause them to explode (Hello, World) and wipe the raid.Hello, Distant Worldfunctions similarly except it targets the furthest players.Each player hit with an AoE from the debuff will receive a stack ofQuickening Dynamis, so each debuff resolution should give one stack to three players, if handled correctly.These AoEs inflictMagic Vulnerability Upso it is important to not overlap with other sources of damage (e.g.,Patchtether breaks).If any player with these debuffs die before they expire, they will explode (Hello, World) and wipe the raid.Solar Ray: A telegraphed, heavy-hitting AoE tankbuster that hits twice and inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring a tank swap or invulnerability cooldown.Run: ****mi* (Delta Version): Massive raidwide damage, requiring heavy mitigation, and begins a series of mechanics:Four random players (two pairs) will receiveRemote Code Smelland be indicated with a semi-transparent blue tether.Among these players,Hello, Near Worldwill be assigned to one, andHello, Distant Worldwill be assigned to another.The other four players (two pairs) will receiveLocal Code Smelland be indicated with a semi-transparent red-and-green tether.The largeeyein Phase 2 will spawn on a random cardinal, which is considered the relative north.Beetle Omegawill spawn relative west, andReconfigured Omegawill spawn relative east.A yellow or blue colored fist add (Rocket Punch) will spawn next to each player. Several seconds after they spawn, they will telegraph a small circular AoE (Explosion) at their target player's location that should be dodged. These fists need to be disarmed by stacking two opposite colored fist AoEs on each other. Failing to do so will cause them to explode (Unmitigated Explosion) and wipe the raid.For each tether type, the four players will always receive 2 blue and 2 yellow fists. In addition, the following combination of fist colors will always be assigned to the tethered pairs: 1 yellow-yellow, 1 blue-blue, and 2 yellow-blue.If players are not stacked with a partner or are moving when the fists lock on, the AoE telegraphs will not appear, and the fists will explode and wipe the raid.Theeyewill useOptical Laser, hitting the middle of the arena with a large line AoE.Around this time,Remote Code Smellwill turn intoRemote Regression, requiring the blue tethered players to break them sequentially by moving apart.Local Code Smellwill also turn intoLocal Regression, although the duration of this debuff is longer. Therefore, the red/green tether players will avoid breaking their tethers until the end of the mechanic.SixLeft/Right Arm Unitswill spawn outside the arena, 60 degrees from each other. These will telegraph either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation according to the arrows. They will aim a telegraphed line AoE (Hyper Pulse) to the nearest player that will rotate according to the telegraph. These will need to be baited so they rotate away from the inside of the arena to avoid hitting anyone.Omega-Mat the center of the arena will useBeyond Defenseon either the closest or second-closest player. Afterwards, it will usePile Pitchon the closest player, a stack AoE that needs to be shared by three players, while the player hit byBeyond Defensestays out.At the same time,Reconfigured Omegawill castOversampled Wave Cannon, while a random player that originally hadRemote Code Smellwill receiveOversampled Wave Cannon Loading, making for 2 sets of "monitor" AoEs. These will need to be baited by the four players not soakingPile Pitchor hit byBeyond Defenseto prevent overlapping damage.Finally,Beetle Omegawill useSwivel Cannon, a large cleave that hits more than half of the arena based on which side of the boss has glowing orbs. This will be briefly telegraphed by an orange indicator. The party will need to dodge to the safe side while positioning forHello, Near WorldandHello, Distant Worldbaits, which will resolve.Around this time,Local Regressionwill soon expire, requiring the red/green tethered players to break them sequentially by moving towards their tether partner. One pair will break after the Thrice-come Ruins from Oversampled Wave Cannon / Beyond Defense / Pile Pitch have expired, and the final pair will break after the Magic Vulnerability Ups from Hello, Near/Distant World have expired.If the mechanic is correctly resolved, six players will have one stack ofQuickening Dynamis.Solar Rayis used again when the boss becomes targetable.Run: ****mi* (Sigma Version): Massive raidwide damage, requiring heavy mitigation, and begins a series of mechanics:One random player will receiveHello, Near Worldand another random player will receiveHello, Distant World.Similar toParty Synergyin phase 2, the party will receive eitherMid GlitchorRemote Glitch. These function as before, and all players will receive the same debuff. The colored overhead "playstation" markers to identify tethered player pairs will also appear.Reconfigured Omegawill spawn in the middle of the arena.Omega-Mwill spawn at a random cardinal, which will be considered the new north. TwoLeft Arm Unitswill spawn, one relative southwest and the other relative southeast.TheArm Unitswill target and automatically tether the furthest players from them. These players will be hit withHyper Pulse, a line AoE that deals damage and inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up.Six players will be marked with an orange marker, indicating thatReconfigured Omegawill target them withWave Cannon, a conal AoE that deals damage and inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up.Two tethered player pairs will always receive a marker. For the remaining two tethered player pairs, one player in each pair will receive a marker, while the other is unmarked.The party will need to spread to clock positions that are determined by the pattern of orange markers to take the conal and line AoEs, while positioning to satisfy the distance requirement ofGlitchand avoid lethal damage.The two double marked pairs will spread to the relative cardinals (north, south, east, west) aroundReconfigured Omegain the center.The two single marked pairs will spread to the relative intercardinals (northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest). Theunmarkedplayers will baitHyper Pulse, requiring them to position to relative northwest and northeast to ensure they are the furthest player from their respectiveArm Unit. TheirGlitchtether partner will be directly opposite them and behind theArm Unit.IfMid Glitchis active, all players will position between the third and fourth "ring" of the arena.IfRemote Glitchis active, all players will position at the wall.During this, all players will be inflicted withLooperfromBeetle Omega. After baiting the AoEs, either five or six towers will spawn based on the activeGlitchdebuff. Towers will be at the wall. The two possible tower patterns will always be oriented "north" or "south" based on whereOmega-Mspawned at the start. These must be soaked by either one or two players, as indicated by the number of orbs rotating around each tower.Omega-Fwill appear and castDischarger, knocking all players back from the center. The party must position to be knocked back into their assigned tower that also satisfies theGlitchdistance requirement to prevent lethal damage from soaking the tower.IfMid Glitchis active, six towers will spawn in a "smiley face" pattern. Two towers (the ones at the ends of the "smile") require two players to soak, while the remaining four towers require one player each. Each player should be in the center of their tower to help satisfyGlitch.IfRemote Glitchis active, five towers will spawn in a "pentagon" pattern. Three towers (the northmost and two southmost) require two players, while the remaining three towers require one player each.  Each player should be at the wall in their tower to satisfyGlitch.After soaking the towers and cleansingLooper, theGlitchdebuffs will also expire, and the second half of this mechanic will begin.ARear Power Unitwill spawn in the center and face a random cardinal or intercardinal. It will also telegraph either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation. This add will use a persistent line AoE (Rear Lasers) through where it is facing that will rotate according to the arrows, approximately 100 degrees.Omega-Fwill spawn in front of theRear Power Unitand is considered the relative north of this mechanic. She will either have astaff, telegraphing a cross AoE (Optimized Blizzard III) orbladed legs, telegraphing two AoEs that hit her flanks (Superliminal Steel) as in Phase 2.TwoRight Arm Unitswill spawn outside of the arena at relative southwest and relative southeast. These will each use aHyper Pulseline AoE baited to the furthest player.The party will need to split up to dodge the AoEs and end up in positions that correctly baitHyper Pulsefrom the arms andHello, Near/Distant World, which will resolve after the AoEs finish.Three players need to start nearOmega-F. To qualify for this role, these players must have1 stack ofQuickening DynamisandNOT haveHello, Near/Distant World.The five remaining players will start away fromOmega-Fnear relative south. This group will include the two players withHello, Near/Distant World.All players should preposition away from the path of theRear Power Unitinitial line AoE and rotation.In the north group, the three players should determine two players to baitHyper Pulseand the remaining person to baitHello, Distant World.In the south group, the three playerswithout Hello, Near/Distant Worldshould determine two players to baitHello, Near Worldand the remaining person to baitHello, Distant World.WhenRear Lasersbegin firing, players should be mindful ofOmega-F's AoE. If she has astaff, the party should wait until the cross AoE resolves before moving with the laser rotation. If she hasbladed legs, the party should move in line with her immediately when safe.Afterwards, the party should go to their final positions.One player each in the north group will go relative northwest and relative northeast at the wall to baitHyper Pulse, as they will be the furthest players from theArm Units.The remaining north group player should be relative north at the wall (whereOmega-Fwas located) to baitHello, Distant World.TheHello, Distant Worlddebuff player in the south group will be relative south, around a quarter into the arena.TheHello, Distant Worldbaiter in the south group will be relative south at the wall.TheHello, Near Worlddebuff player in the south group either be relative east or west (depending on the laser rotation), around a quarter into the arena.The twoHello, Near Worldbaiters in the south group be near theHello, Near Worlddebuff player but at the wall.If this mechanic is correctly resolved, four players will have 2 stacks ofQuickening Dynamisand the remaining four players will have 1 stack.After the mechanic concludes,Omega-Fwill be the targetable boss and will share the same health asOmega-M. She will useSolar Ray, which is handled as before.Run: ****mi* (Omega Version): Massive raidwide damage, requiring heavy mitigation, and begins a series of mechanics. Unlike the previous versions, the boss remains targetable and will continue to auto-attack the main tank.Two random players will be givenFirst in Lineand two other random players will be givenSecond in Line. For each numbered debuff, one player will receiveHello, Near Worldand the other will receiveHello, Distant World, making for a total of fourHello, Near/Distant Worlddebuffs.Reconfigured Omegawill spawn in the middle, while anOmega-MandOmega-Fclone will appear at two random opposite intercardinals. AnotherOmega-MandOmega-Fclone will then appear at the remaining opposite intercardinals.Reconfigured Omegawill begin castingDiffuse Wave Cannon, two wide conal AoEs that will hit north/south or east/west based on the orientation of its glowing "fins", leaving the cardinals at the tips of the fins safe. After the first set of conal AoEs, it will cleave the previously safe cardinals.TheOmega-MandOmega-Fclones will telegraph attacks based on their stances, similar to inParty Synergy, in the order the clone pairs spawned.The party must locate the first safe spot to dodge the first sets ofclone AoEsandDiffuse Wave Cannon, then rotate 90 degrees to the second safe spot for the next set of AoEs.Once both sets of AoEs resolve,Omega-Fwill disappear and become untargetable.Reconfigured Omegawill begin castingOversampled Wave Cannon, with monitors to either its east or west, requiring two people to bait the "monitor" AoEs, while the rest of the party is on the non-monitor side. Players not baiting the monitor AoEs will instead bait the first sets ofHello, Near/Distant Worldfrom the players withFirst in Line.Players with2 stacksofQuickening DynamisandSecond in Lineare required to soak monitors, because they will be receiving their third Dynamis stack in the last part of this mechanic. If there is only one or if no player meets these conditions, players with2 stacksofQuickening Dynamisshould be prioritized.Beetle Omegawill appear at the wall and tether two players, who will be hit withBlaster. The two players with3 stacksofQuickening Dynamiswill need to pick these up and position near the relative intercardinal sides ofBeetle Omega. The remaining players will bait the second sets ofHello, Near/Distant Worldfrom the players withSecond in Line.If this mechanic series is correctly resolved, all players will have 3 stacks ofQuickening Dynamis.While the clone attacks in the first part of the mechanic are not lethal to anyone if they are shielded, it will inflict a 90%Damage Down. Anyone hit should run into the death wall and then be resurrected once the mechanic series is over, to cleanse this debuff.Omega-Fwill useSolar Raya final time. The death wall will then disappear before the enrage cast.Blind Faith:Enrage.The boss must be reduced to less than 20% health or the party will wipe. If the party meets the DPS check, it will do high raidwide damage and knock everyone back to the wall, although they will not fall off. Instead, a cutscene ensues ofAlphaattempting to comfort the seemingly defeatedOmega-Fbefore fusing with it and transforming intoAlpha OmegaPhase 6:Alpha OmegaAfter the cutscene, the death wall will respawn, so the party should quickly move out of it before they die, as they will be invulnerable for a short while.This phase requires that all party members had 3 stacks ofQuickening Dynamisat the end of phase 5. Players with 3 stacks will obtainBrilliant Dynamis, allowing them to freely use alevel 3 limit breakcorresponding to their role (i.e., the limit break gauge will be refund by 3 full bars when a limit break is used by a player with this buff). When they use their free limit break, their buff will turn intoSpark of Dynamis. Any player withoutBrilliant DynamisorSpark of Dynamiswill also take lethal damage from any of the boss's attacks.These buffs are lost on death, so it is critical to not die. A total of10level 3 limit breaks should be used during this phase: 3 from tanks, 2 from healers, 1 from magical ranged DPS, and 1 from physical ranged DPS to handle certain mechanics. The remaining 3 limit breaks from 2 remaining (preferably melee) DPS should be used to help meet the DPS check. The 2 limit breaks not covered byBrilliant Dynamisare enabled by natural limit break gauge generation during this phase. The party is required to have 3 full limit break bars coming into the phase, because the first mandatory level 3 limit break is at the start, and the buff does not allow players to limit break without a filled gauge (it refunds the gauge cost afterwards).Cosmo Memory: Catastrophic raidwide damage that requires alevel 3 tank limit breakand some additional party mitigation to survive.Flash Gale (auto-attacks): The boss will use two sets of auto-attacks between each mechanic. These will hit both the highest enmity player and the furthest player with a small AoE that inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring both tanks to be isolated and for the off-tank to be the furthest player (outside the hitbox) to bait the auto-attacks, while the party is inside the hitbox.Cosmo Arrow: Telegraphs two wide line AoEs that form a plus shape through the middle of the arena followed by four line AoEs that form a box on the outside, or vice versa. These AoEs will cascade outwards as narrower line AoEs multiple times, resulting in two possible dodge patterns depending on the pattern of the initial AoE spawns. Anyone hit by the AoEs will die.Cosmo Dive: The furthest player is targeted with a large AoE that inflicts stack damage, while the two closest players are each hit with a large tankbuster AoE. The two tanks should be well inside the hitbox while the remaining 6 players stack slightly inside. Each hit inflicts massive damage and requires heavy mitigation or invulnerabilty cooldowns.Unlimited Wave Cannon: Four "exaflare" AoEs will sequentially spawn on adjacent cardinals/intercardinals, while six large circular AoEs will sequentially appear at each player's location. Starting from the center, the party will move next to the first "exaflare" that spawns and into the previously unsafe areas while remaining stacked to bait the ground AoEs.Wave Cannon: While the cast bar is filling, four random players will be targeted with a line AoE that inflicts high damage andMagic Vulnerability Up, followed by the four remaining players. When the cast bar fills, a random player will be targeted with a line stack AoE that inflicts massive damage and requires heavy mitigation. The two tanks must be in front of the party stack as they will take significantly increased damage, requiring heavy personal mitigation or invulnerability cooldowns.Cosmo Arrowwill be used again, immediately followed by anotherWave Cannon. This requires the party to spread while dodging the Cosmo Arrow AoEs, as four players will be hit with Wave Cannon before the previous AoE sets fully resolve.After two more auto-attacks,Unlimited Wave Cannonwill be used again, immediately followed by anotherCosmo Dive.Cosmo Meteor: Begins a series of mechanics.A large telegraphed AoE will spawn under each player. The party should stack in the middle to bait these, then spread to their clock positions, with the physical ranged DPS going north.Four random players will be hit with an untelegraphed circular AoE that inflicts high damage andMagic Vulnerability Up, followed by the other four players.Two largeCosmo Meteoradds will spawn at the north and south, while six smallCosmo Cometadds will spawn at east, west, and the intercardinals. These must be destroyed in time or they will explode and wipe the party. To destroy these, alevel 3 magical ranged DPS limit breakmust be used to hit all the adds. Afterwards, alevel 3 physical ranged DPS limit breakmust be used to finish off theCosmo Meteoradds, which have more health.During this sequence, the random untelegraphed AoEs that hit four players, followed by the other four players will repeat.Three random players will receive a flare marker. They must be taken to east, west, and opposite the physical ranged DPS at north to lower the proximity damage. The rest of the party will need to stack with the physical ranged DPS (if they do not have a flare marker) or south (if they do have a flare marker), because a random non-flare player will be hit with an untelegraphed split damage AoE that deals high damage, requiring mitigation.Magic Number: Massive raidwide damage that requires alevel 3 tank limit breakto survive. All players will be inflicted withMagic Number, which must be cleansed with alevel 3 healer limit breakor they will die. This attack will be used twice in a row.Run: ****mi*:Enrage.The boss must be defeated before this long cast finishes or the party will wipe. Unlike previous ultimate raids, the enrage sequence does not consist of individual party members sacrificing themselves.Reward1Omega TotemOmega Protocol Adventurer PlateWhen originally released, you could receive only one reward item per week for completing The Omega Protocol (Ultimate).
