The walking fortress has stirred once more, and its left arm now rests on the banks of the Thaliak. The entrance lies open and unguarded, suggesting the goblins inside are as surprised as you. Take advantage of your enemy's unreadiness and face the Illuminati threat once more─hopefully for the last time.— In-game descriptionAlexander - The Fist of the Sonis a level 60raidintroduced inpatch 3.2withHeavensward.

Off-tank should temporarily provoke the boss at 4 to intercept the tankbuster. After recovering, the MT can then takes the boss back, or the tanking can hard swap on each Concussion, depending on the group's preference.Adds will spawn in the corners of the room; they need to be tanked.If you get a red-orange marker over your head, run away from the party. This will drop a large puddle which deals significant damage to anyone standing in it.The tower in the center of the room has a purple circle around it. Standing near the circle brings up two puddles on the sides of the room, which are necessary for countering certain boss abilities.  Standing near the tower too long will inflict damage, however, so the circle should be avoided except to spawn the puddles.Red puddle will turn you into a gorilla, giving you a skill to knock bombs far away from the party before they explode. More bombs will spawn each time he summons them (first one, then two, then three).  The explosion radius is just slightly smaller than the width of the arena, so ideally the bombs should be pushed into the corner opposite where the boss and party are at.  If they are pushed into an adjacent corner or against a wall, ensure you hug the opposite wall tightly to avoid the explosion.The violet puddle will turn you into a bird. When the boss is extra large and uses "Boost", become a bird or you'll likely die to his multiple groundpound attacks. Skill #1 allows you to do a little damage, skill #2 will turn you back into yourself.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Midan LensOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan SpringOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Midan LensOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan CrankOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan PedalOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan BoltOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Midas I10Discover every location withinAlexander: Midas - the Fist of the Son.-3.2RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
