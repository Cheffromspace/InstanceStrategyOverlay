Forming the main thrust, the Immortal Flames will strike at the stronghold with all their strength, though this is but a feint. While the garrison's eyes are drawn outwards, you and your comrades must steal past its defences and attempt to deactivate the magitek field which protects the Praetorium, the fortress within a fortress wherein the Ultima Weapon is believed to be housed.— In-game descriptionCastrum Meridianumis a level 50dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.Contents1General Information2Duty Support3Objectives4Bosses4.1The Black Eft4.2Magitek Vanguard F-14.3Livia sas Junius5Loot6Achievements6.1Images7Lore7.1Operation Archon7.2Magitek Vanguard H-17.3Magitek Colossus Rubricatus7.4MoreGeneral InformationAs ofpatch 4.2, to ensure new players are able to enjoy the cutscenes inCastrum Meridianumandthe Praetorium, all cutscenes in these dungeons can no longer be skipped.

Foremost among them was Castrum Meridianum, Gaius van Baelsar’s seat of power. Situated in northern Thanalan, the site was chosen for its rich deposits of ceruleum—fuel for the Empire’s machina and the lifeblood of its conquest. Upon occupying the area, the legatus ordered the construction of a facility to refine the raw liquid, thereby achieving self-sufficiency for his campaign and ending his dependence on the Garlean motherland.Struggling simply to rebuild, the nations of Eorzea could only watch on as the castrum’s intimidating silhouette took form to dominate the landscape. But years later, the opportunity would come to take action—via the large-scale military strategy dubbed Operation Archon. Bringing all of their resources to bear, the Grand Companies isolated Castrum Meridianum from its sister strongholds with coordinated strikes before turning their eyes upon the main prize. It was a delicate dance that demanded audacity, finesse, and no small amount of luck, but each of the units involved came through to guide the operation to success.All their efforts were for but one purpose: the destruction of the Ultima Weapon. Once the way was clear for an elite adventurer unit to carry out this task, the Grand Companies withdrew their forces to avoid unnecessary losses. After the dust had settled, the remnants of the XIVth were suffered to remain, but the Black Wolf’s legion had effectively been defanged.Magitek Vanguard H-1Fitted with additional plate, this heavy variant of the vanguard sacrifices mobility for defense. Though not apparent at a glance it also boasts a more powerful ceruleum engine.Magitek Colossus RubricatusAn enhanced version of the autonomous colossus, this model incorporates experimental technology that draws upon an external energy source to augment power. The first units manufactured were deployed to guard the Praetorium.MoreBy reproducing the workings of arcane shields with magitek, the Garleans succeeded in enveloping Castrum Meridianum in an energy field that could withstand powerful magical attacks. In order to defeat such a field, one must either subject it to a tremendous burden or destroy its generator from within, the latter method being undertaken by the Eorzean Alliance during Operation Archon.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
