ImportantThe North American and European data centers primarily useParty Finderto challenge (Extreme) content. Using Duty Finder to match with random players is not recommended and will be more difficult than pre-forming a party. For an easy completion (that will satisfy any quest requirements) or loot farming, it is recommended that players use Party Finder and form anUnrestricted Party(i.e., with level sync disabled). Players who wish to complete this duty with level sync enabled should also form a pre-made party, which also enables the use ofMinimum Item LevelandSilence Echosettings for a more authentic challenge compared to a Duty Finder party.This article is about the level 70 challenge-modetrial.

A man who lives only for death. As one they fought the Warrior of Light, and as one they fell. No words could do this titanic encounter justice... unless they come from the wandering minstrel, to whom no event is beyond improvement. As his nimble fingers pluck out the chords, his rich voice carries you to a place above the world, one that is at once familiar and foreign:Shinryu's domain.— In-game descriptionThe Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domainis a level 70trialintroduced inpatch 4.1withStormblood.Contents1Strategy1.1Primal: Shinryu1.2Phase 11.3Transition1.4Phase 22Loot2.1Treasure Coffer3Achievements4ImagesStrategyThe Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain - Primal GuidePrimal:ShinryuMuch like normal mode, your battle against Shinryu will involve the presence of aCorrupted Aether Gauge. Once the gauge reaches 100, Shinryu will execute a special attack. In addition, players must also contend withThe Worm's Heart- an attackable piece of Shinryu that will regenerate over the course of the battle. If theCorrupted Aether Gaugereaches maximum whileThe Worm's Heartis active, participants will suffer an unavoidable raid-wipe. However, whenever the heart is destroyed, Shinryu will suffer major damage. Inbetween each ultimate, Shinryu will use its left and right-wing to bombard the raid with further mechanics.Unlike normal mode, your battle against Shinryu will immediately begin on the chequered platform seen in Phase 2 of Normal mode. Furthermore, the middle tile can now be destroyed, and should that happen, the raid will suffer an unavoidable wipe. All tiles (including the central tile) can only withstand two direct attacks from Shinryu before breaking, so watch out!Lastly, both the main enmity target and the off-tank will suffer continuous auto-attacks from Shinryu, keeping Healers on their toes throughout the battle.Phase 1With the above notes in mind, participants should begin the battle by immediately destroyingThe Worm's Heartas soon as possible.Earthen Fury (Ultimate)is scripted to be the first ultimate attack once theCorrupted Aether Gaugeis full, resulting in unavoidable damage to the entire raid and outright destroying the eastern and western tiles, as well as dealing one hit to various other platforms (leaving noticeable cracks).Burning Chainswill tether individual players to another in their respective roles; such as the two tanks, the two healers, and damage-dealers to a fellow damage-dealer. These chains can be broken by stretching them (i.e, tethered players running in opposite directions). If they are not broken in time, tethered players will be afflicted withFire DamageandSupperationdebuffs.Tidal Wave (Ultimate), another ultimate attack that requires 100Corrupted Aether, will create a whirlpool at either the west, east or southern side of the platform that will eventually inflict a major knockback along with moderate raid damage. Participants must stand close to the whirlpool in order to avoid being punted off the platform, though they must also be mindful of overlapping mechanics and missing platform tiles when doing so.Water Puddleswill form at various locations whenever Shinryu executes awateroricebased ultimate (such as above-mentionedTidal Wave). By standing in a puddle, players will gain a majorFire Resistancebuff but also a massiveLightning Vulnerabilitydebuff. These must be used (or avoided) when dealing with certain fire or lighting based mechanics later on. Bear in mind that these puddles will be destroyed viaFireorLightningmechanics.Summon Icicle, a special attack by Shinryu'sLeft Wing, will summon 3 icicles at the edge of the platform (opposite Shinryu's current location) which will eventually dash across the entire platform in a straight line, inflicting damage, knockback and debuffs to anyone caught in their path. To avoid, players must position themselves out of harm's way.Tail Slamwill mark a random healer with a noticeable green icon resembling Shinryu's tail. After a brief delay, Shinryu will slam down its tail (from the side of the platform closest to the marked player) and deal damage to two tiles, as well as anyone caught in its path. If the tail-marker is dropped in a way where it will collide with at least one undamaged tile, the tail will remain attackable for a brief period, giving the raid an opportunity to destroy it for major damage to Shinryu. If, however, the tail-marker is dropped on two damaged tiles, both tiles will immediately be destroyed with no opportunity to attack the tail, which also leaves the group with less room to deal with future mechanics.Shortly after the firstTail Slamhas finished, one of two abilities cast by Shinryu'sRight Wingwill land. This can either beLevinbolt- a lightning spell that will blast each player with AoE lightning (amplified on anyone standing within awater puddle) - orHypernova- a concentrated blast of fire damage that requires players to stack within awater puddleand share the damage. Bear in mind thatLevinboltis indicated by a purple-coloured icon, whereasHypernovais indicated by a flaming orange icon.The Worm's Heartwill regenerate, placing the raid under a DPS check where they must once again destroy the heart before theCorrupted Aether Gaugereaches full.Ice Storm, an unavoidable raid-wide damage ability from Shinryu'sLeft Wing, will follow soon after, loosely overlapped by Shinryu'sCentral Slam- a direct attack on the central tile that must be avoided.Akh Morn, a vicious tank-buster that requires both tanks to share damage via heavy mitigation cooldowns. Alternatively, a lone tank can utilize an immunity cooldown instead. This ability will overlap withAkh Rhal.Akh Rhalwill target the ground beneath a random damage dealer and blast that location with vicious AoE damage after a brief delay. All players must move away from the affected area if they wish to avoid major damage.At this point, Shinryu will prepare to cast one of two ultimate abilities once theCorrupted Aether Gaugehas been filled -HellfireorJudgement Bolt. Regardless of which attack is chosen, it will overlap with anotherSummon Icicle, so watch out!Hellfire (Ultimate), likeHypernova, requires players to utilize a water puddle in order to acquireFire Resistance Upand absorb the damage (whilst simultaneously avoidingSummon Icicle).Judgement Bolt (Ultimate), being lightning-based, requires players to avoid both the water puddles and summoned icicles simultaneously. In addition, the 1-4 players hit byJudgement Boltwill be afflicted with a dispellable paralysis debuff that should be removed as soon as possible.Bear in mind that either ultimate will cleanse the platform of all remainingwater puddles.Tail Slamwill now mark a random damage-dealer instead of a healer, but is dealt with the same way as before. Be sure you place it so that the tail collides with at least one undamaged platform (preferably the centre if it is undamaged), allowing the raid to counter-attack the tail and potentially destroy it for major damage to Shinryu. Much like before, theTail Slamwill be loosely overlapped byLevin Bolt, meaning players should be ready to spread out and avoid clipping each other with AoE lightning damage, which is then followed by anotherIce Storm(unavoidable AoE damage).The Worm's Heartwill once again regenerate, pressuring the group with another DPS check. Make sure the heart is destroyed before theCorrupted Aether Gaugereaches full!Burning Chains, unlike before, will now tether all healers and tanks - but not damage dealers. Despite this, the chains are dealt with in the exact same manner - moving in opposite directions to stretch them out until they break.Earth Breathwill mark one healer and one damage dealer with a noticeable marker. After a brief delay, Shinryu will blast both of the marked players with an AoE attack. Those marked byEarth Breathshould position themselves so that the following AoE attack does not hit other members of the raid.Akh MornandAkh Rhalwill follow shortly and is dealt with in the same manner as before. However, bear in mind that the Akh-combo will be overlapped with anotherIce Storm(unavoidable AoE damage) which may prove fatal for anyone on low health.Diamond Dust (Ultimate)will blanket all remaining tiles in ice, causing anyone who moves to slide a sizeable distance in the direction they moved in. To make matters worse, both Healers will be tethered byBurning Chains, forcing them to slide in opposite directions to break the chains as soon as possible without sliding off the platform to their doom. Due to being an ice ultimate,Diamond Dustwill form newwater puddlesaround the platform.Reiryu (4x Adds)will now be summoned around the platform and tether themselves to an individual player. Each add must be healed to full (rather than destroyed) in order to defeat them. Failure to do so will cause each unhealed add to crash down upon the tethered target and inflict raid-wide damage and debuffs. During this time, a tank will be marked for anotherTail Slam. If all is going well, there should be one undamaged tile remaining, so be sure to bait the slam so that the tail lands on the undamaged tile - giving the raid another opportunity to destroy the tail and inflict bonus damage to Shinryu.The Worm's Heartwill regenerate once more, providing another DPS check before the next ultimate attack. Simultaneously, participants must deal with anotherAkh Morn&Akh Rhalcombo, along withSummoned Icicles.Aerial Blast (Ultimate)will conjure a whirling tornado on the central tile that will regularly knock players away from the centre. After a few minor pushbacks, players will be hit by a final blast which will knock players away by a greater distance, so be sure to position yourself so that you aren't knocked over the edge of the platform. Bear in mind thatAerial Blastwill be loosely overlapped byBurning Chainson random damage dealers who may need to utilize the knockback to break their chains, or be ready to do so as soon as possible onceAerial Blasthas finished.Earth Breathwill once again mark a healer a damage dealer, forcing them to move away so that the rest of the raid isn't clipped by upcoming AoE damage. This will be overlapped by yet anotherIcestorm(unavoidable AoE), so be ready to shield or heal upcoming damage.Divebombwill cause Shinryu to fly to a corner of the arena and prepare to swoop across it in a diagonal line, forcing players to move to an adjacent tile to avoid being caught in its path. Unlike normal mode, this mechanic will not come with an obvious telegraph. Once complete, Shinryu will land once more, possibly at a different side of the arena.NOTE: At this point, Shinryu will cycle through familiar mechanics until it is brought down to 44% health or lower, resulting in a transition to Phase 2.TransitionJust like normal mode, all players will be bound before anActive Time Manoeuvretakes place. Assuming you successfully free yourself, players will be transported to a new area, whereas those who failed will be instantly killed.Phase 2The new phase begins withTouchdown, a proximity-based landing from Shinryu that will inflict damage and a massive knockback. The entire raid should immediately rush to the north of the platform so that the resulting knockback successfully launches them to another tile in the distance. Upon landing, players must continue moving north to avoid damage from more proximity markers around the rest of the arena, each of which will drop a meteor-like egg that hatches into multiple adds - one large add and four smaller ones. Bear in mind that the larger adds are capable of castingDeath Sentence, which should be interrupted whenever possible.After a brief delay, more proximity markers will indicate the arrival of even more adds - this time, two large adds and three smaller ones.Finally, five random players will be marked via massive AoE markers, forcing the raid to spread out to avoid unnecessary damage. After a brief delay, these markers will become the location for one final wave of proximity markers that will drop more add-spawning meteors, resulting in five small adds.During the entire add phase, Shinryu will be gathering moreCorrupted Aether. If Shinryu accumulates 100 aether before the add phase is completed, the raid will suffer a wipe.Protostarwill inflict massive raid-wide damage if the group successfully defeated all adds before the aether gauge was filled.Tail Spitfollows, marking the centre of the arena with a shimmering blue marker. After a brief delay, Shinryu will smash its tail into the marker, knocking everyone backwards. Players must move close to (but not inside) the marker in a way where they will be knocked to a diagonal corner of the arena, as being knocked to the sides will likely result in falling over the edge. All players who survive the knockback can now walk across Shinryu's tail to the first platform. However, Shinryu will pepper the raid with laser beams as they attempt to cross the void, so be careful!Players who managed to cross the void onto Shinryu's platform will notice aDoom Puddlewithin its hitbox. This pulsating puddle of darkness will inflict doom on anyone who stands within it. Should a player remain in the puddle for ten seconds, they will immediately perish. For the following mechanics, players should group up in front of Shinryu.Tera Slashis a vicious tank buster that will inflictPhysical Vulnerability Upagainst the target. As a result, tanks should co-ordinate a tank-swap while it is being cast.Burning Chainswill afflict every member of the group, forcing tethered players to move in opposite directions in order to break them.Atomic Ray- a sharable damage & debuff AoE - will loosely overlapBurning Chains. Unlike regular stack markers,Atomic Rayis a staggered attack that will inflictMagic Vulnerability Upto anyone caught in the blast, preventing the entire raid from stacking up into a single group. Instead, all players should split up into pairs as soon as theBurning Chainshave been broken. This will help to prevent multiple applications of vulnerability being multi-stacked on the entire group.Shinryu will now comboIcestormwith one of two additional mechanics -HypernovaorLevinbolt. Bear in mind that during this phase,Icestormwill freeze any player who is not moving when it has been cast. This needs to be avoided (or allowed) depending on the mechanic that will overlap withIcestorm.Levinbolt- a delayed blast of lightning that will affect the area that each player was standing in when the cast has been completed. In short, onceLevinbolthas been cast, players must move away from where they were standing at the time. Due to the overlappingIcestorm, players can deal with this combo by standing together near the boss (to baitLevinboltsinto a predictable area), moving on the spot to avoid beingfrozenbyIcestorm, then moving around the boss (preferably away from each other) to avoid the oncomingLevinboltdamage in the baited area.Hypernova- a delayed blast of sharable fire damage. Without protection, the damage is particularly vicious, hence players should stack together and allowIcestormto freeze the entire group together, giving them some much-needed fire resistance. On doing so, the group will share the damage and eventually be thawed out of the ice by the resulting fire damage-over-time. Once released, Healers should be ready to top up the group as soon as possible.Shinryu will follow-up on the previous combo with one of two abilities:Benightning BreathorWyrmwall.Benightning Breathis a large frontal AoE with a bright purple telegraph that can cover a sizeable portion of the arena. Anyone unlucky enough to be caught in the following blast will take immense damage and also receive anInfirmitydebuff. By comparison,Wyrmwallis an arena-wide attack with only one safe spot inside Shinryu's hitbox. Due to this area being covered by theDoom Puddle, players who linger too long within the safe spot (10 seconds) will undoubtedly be slain outright by doom.Tera Slash- the vicious tank buster that appliesPhysical Vulnerability Up- will be executed straight after the above combo, thus both tanks need to be ready to swap as it is being cast.Reiryu (4x Adds)will once again be summoned around the platform and are dealt in the same manner as they were in Phase 1. They cannot be killed, only healed, and any add not healed to maximum health in time will unleash unwanted damage and debuffs. While the Healers handle this mechanic, the rest of the group should take the opportunity to inflict as much damage to Shinryu as possible between other mechanics.Tera Slashwill be used once again, forcing another tank-swap.Burning Chainswill once again overlap withAtomic Ray, forcing the group to break their chains, preferably in pairs so that they can appropriately absorbAtomic Raywithout clipping or applying debuffs to anyone else around them.Benightning BreathorWyrmwallfollows once more, both of which are dealt with in the same manner as before, completing what will eventually become a mechanical loop until Shinryu has been reduced down to <25% health.When Shinryu reaches 22% HP remaining, it will cease attacking and slowly begin castingTidal Wave, a hard enrage. As soon as it begins, small launch markers will appear on the platform that allows players to leap up onto Shinryu's back. While there, players can now target Shinryu's right and left wings, both of which will be also be long-casting a hard enrage ability,HellfireandJudgement Bolt, respectively. Though defeating Shinyru will automatically end the fight, there is astronomically little chance of accomplishing this before one of the wings finishes casting their enrage, so the wings must be both defeated not only to stop their casts, but to also deal signifigant damage to Shinyru. Once both wings are dispatched, quickly DPS down Shinyru's remianing health beforeTidal Wavegoes off, and the trial will be over.LootSee also:Shinryu's WeaponsEach player will receive 1Shinryu Totemper kill.
