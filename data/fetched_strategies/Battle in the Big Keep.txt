Gilgamesh journeys ever onward in his unending quest for the strongest of swords. But the road is long and lonesome, and a painted rooster─loyal and noble as the bird may be─can bring a man only so much comfort in the darkest and most trying of times. So it was that Gilgamesh turned to the heavens, pleading to be reunited with a long-lost companion. Be it by fortune or fate, his prayers were heard, and the stage for the final confrontation is set.

The closer Gilgamesh is to the chain, the harder it is to kill.Sword Dance: Frontal multihit cleave attack on the MT. Basically a tankbuster.
