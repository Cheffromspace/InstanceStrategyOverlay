But what is happiness? In pursuit of an answer, the Loporrits created the Big Cheese, designed to make manifest all they might need and more to fulfill the needs of their passengers-to-be. They were eager to please─perhaps, too eager─and their plans became more fickle, each new idea a betrayal of the last. The Big Cheese now burrows toward the center of the moon, a labyrinth of contradiction left in its wake. If left unchecked, its wanton pursuit of happiness may very well spell the end of the moon.— In-game descriptionSmiletonis a level 90dungeonintroduced inpatch 6.0withEndwalker.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Face2.2Frameworker2.3Smilemaker: The Big Cheese3Loot3.1Face3.2Frameworker3.3The Big Cheese3.4Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X:9.6 Y:12.8)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X:11.6 Y:10.8)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X:12.5 Y:11.5)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X:11.4 Y:8.4)4Achievements5Images5.1Gear Images5.2Dungeon ImagesObjectivesArrive at Smileport: 0/1Clear Smileport: 0/1Arrive at the Welcome Wheel: 0/1Clear the Welcome Wheel: 0/1Arrive at the Frame: 0/1Defeatthe Big Cheese: 0/1BossesDungeon Guide by MTQcaptureFailing any mechanics in these fights will result in a two minute stackingVulnerability Updebuff.FaceLines of Fire: The boss will tether to the face statues outside of the arena, and several line AoEs will appear that force players into alignment with one of the statues.
