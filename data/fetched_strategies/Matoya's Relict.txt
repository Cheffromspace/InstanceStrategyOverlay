It is there, hidden amidst overgrown foliage, that the entrance to the former workshop of the Archon Matoya can be found. Seeking to create a familiar that creates familiars, you throw open the doors and step into the "moldy old hole"─the first souls to do so in decades...— In-game descriptionMatoya's Relictis a level 80dungeonintroduced inpatch 5.4withShadowbringers.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Mudman3.2Nixie3.3Porcine Porcelain: Mother Porxie4Loot4.1Mudman4.2Nixie4.3Mother Porxie4.4Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 12.4 Y: 10.6)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 10.5 Y: 10.2)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 11.8 Y: 13.4)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 11.7 Y: 11.1)5Achievements6Images6.1Gear Images6.2Dungeon Images6.3Other ImagesDuty SupportParty member selection is available.G'raha TiaAlphinaudAlisaieY'shtolaClassAll-RounderAcademicianRed MageSorceressRoleAnyHealerDPSDPSObjectivesArrive at the Claydot Cauldron: 0/1Clear the Claydot Cauldron: 0/1Arrive at the Clearnote Cauldron: 0/1Clear the Clearnote Cauldron: 0/1Arrive at the Kilnfire Cauldron: 0/1Defeat themother porxie: 0/1BossesMTQcapture GuideVideo GuideMudmanThe key mechanic of this fight is the balls of mud you need to aim into the corners of the room.  Make sure that when you're tethered to a ball, line yourself up so that the ball shoots through you and into a hole in one of the corners of the room.  Keep your eye out for little mud men inside the holes, if you see one, make sure you aim away from THAT hole, as it won't get rid of your ball and you'll continue to take damage from it.AbilitiesHard Rockis a tankbuster ability, healers prepare and tanks pop some cooldownsPetrified Peatis a basic targeted AOE, split up and don't overlap hitboxes.  This will leave mud balls on the battlefield (read Peat Pelt)Peat Peltwill tether you to the balls left on the field.  Position yourself so the balls will shoot through you and into one of the holes on the edges of the battlefield (do not aim towards a hole with a little mud man in it!)Battle Brecciais an inverted cone attack.  Stand directly in front of Mudman, or far enough away to avoid the damageFalling Rockis a stacking indicator ability, make sure you group up to share the damageNixieThe key mechanic of this fight is watching the sides of the room for the water pipes and standing where the water will not hit, as well as making sure you jump into one of the water sprouts that will shoot you up to the cloud where Nixie is singing during the "Singing in the Rain" phase.  If you can do these two things, you'll be good as gold!AbilitiesSmash-Crashis a spell that will create four moving tethers that will follow the single target.  Do not stand on these tethers, as a wind attack will follow.  The target will take moderate damage, so be ready!Shower Powera tether indicator will point you in the direction you need to look, stand in line with the non-glowing pipe to avoid the water blastSinging in the Rainis a field-wide attack where Nixie will float away and create a cloud she stands on. The cast-bar can be seen by targeting an Unfinished Nixie. Water spouts will form around the room, and you need to stand on the one closest to the cloud to join her on the platform.  All players who do not make it up will be killed by a water nova attackUnnamed AOE Targetis a basic targeted group AOE.  Just don't stand near each friends to avoid excess damageUnnamed Water Spoutswill just form around the room (as they did during Singing in the Rain).  Avoid these not get stuck in place and get hit by other attacksPorcine Porcelain:Mother PorxieThe key mechanics in the fight involve running against the wind immediately as you dodge incoming AOEs (otherwise you'll fall into a kill zone), and making sure when you see the room-wide "wind arrows" with a circle safe zone in the middle of the room, you're standing close to Mother Porxie, as she'll blow you back before denoting a room-wide AOE that does massive damage.Tender Loinis a room wide AOE spell that does moderate damage.  Healers be ready to AOE heal after it's castHuff and Puffroom wide gust combined with a room wide devastating AOE.  Stand close to Porxie (not in the safe zone circle), as she'll blow you back into the safe zone before immediately denotating the room wide AOEMeat Malletis a targeted impact zone ability which will indicate the direction you will need to run away from.  Don't stop running away, as she will begin to suck you into a death zone and throw things at you.  No abilities are active during this timeframe so you need to continue holding away from the boss in order to not die!Hidden Huff and Puffis exactly like Huff and Puff, only you do not get any of the usual visual cues at ground level. Instead, a wind sprite will be summoned, which will explode when killed and shoot the party over the haze in the room, revealing Mother Porxie. You will have to deduce her location based upon the wind current indicator at the apex of the launch when the sprite dies. Mother Porxie will reappear just a moment or so before the attack finally finishes charging.Open Flameis a basic targeted AOE ability, don't overlap with your friends to avoid excess damageMinced Meatis a tankbuster single target spell, cooldowns and healing at the ready!LootSee also:Heirloom ArmorandHeirloom AccessoriesMudmanNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityBattledance Materia
