Since that day, they have labored tirelessly to eke out an existence in these harsh and unforgiving lands, slowly but surely expanding their dominion over the entire region. Yet the Ixal have never forgotten that which was once denied them, and so they seek divine intervention once more─to summon Garuda and beseech her strike down their enemies. In the shadow of the First Mountain, the ritual nears completion, as a brave hero once more races against time to deliver the realm from destruction.— In-game descriptionXelphatolis a level 60dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.4withHeavensward.Contents1Duty Support2Objectives3Bosses3.1Nuzal Hueloc3.2Dotoli Ciloc3.3Tozol Huatotl4Loot4.1Nuzal Hueloc4.2Dotoli Ciloc4.3Tozol Huatotl4.4Additional Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 11.0 Y: 10.9)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 11.9 Y: 10.6)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 15.0 Y: 8.9)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 16.3 Y: 6.8)5Achievements6Images6.1Gear Images6.2Dungeon Images7Lore7.1The Home Of The Ixal7.2Nuzal Hueloc7.3Dotoli Ciloc7.4Tozol HuatotlDuty SupportHouse Fortemps KnightAlphinaudHouse Fortemps BanneretHouse Fortemps ArcherClassKnightAcademicianBanneretArcherRoleTankHealer or DPSDPSDPSObjectivesArrive at the Cage.DefatNuzal Hueloc.Arrive in the Tiachtli.DefeatDotoli Ciloc.Eliminate impending enemies.DefeatTozol Huatotl.BossesXelphatol Bosses Guide (Updated for 6.3)Nuzal HuelocWind Blastpath aoeLifthe jumps up and summons 3 adds, kill turret firstAir Raidparty wide aoeHot Airparty wide aoe cast by the turrets, it throws everyone upAirstonean add tethered to the boss or turret, kill asapLong Burstunavoidable, targets random playerWhen 4 airstones appear tethered to a turret, kill the airstones first.

the Black Shroud for fear of the elementals and their boundless wrath, the Ixal settled the windswept mountains of Xelphatol more than five hundred and fifty years ago. In stark contrast to their lush and bounteous former home, these lands situated on the eastern reaches of Abalathia’s Spine were harsh and unforgiving. While water was abundant, the unyielding rock that dominated the landscape suffered no crops to take root and sustained precious little game, and it was all the Ixal could do to eke out an existence. Yet by the same token, they were spared the attentions of outside rivals, and slowly but surely they expanded their dominion over the entire region, making their homes within caves and canyons and fortifying their faith in the Lady of the Vortex.Yet the Ixal never forgot that which was once denied to them, and they sought divine intervention once more—to summon Garuda and beseech her to strike down their enemies. Sensing, the wind’s rising, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn sent forth the Warrior of Light, who traversed a Coerthan mountain pass on his way into the heart of enemy territory to quell the gathering storm.Nuzal HuelocAfter settling in Xelphatol, the Ixal were rendered flightless by a cruel trick of nature, but they eventually soared the skies once more by means of balloons. Borne by smaller crafts, some such
as Nuzal Hueloc are able to fly solo.Dotoli CilocWielding a fan infused with Garuda’s blessing, this Ixali thaumaturge unleashes violent winds that send foes scattering. Outside of battle, she has been known to explore methods of harnessing the fan’s power to increase the cruising speed of her tribe's war balloons.Tozol HuatotlTozol is of the Huatotl blood- line—one of the four great Ixali families said to be descended from the “Skysent.” Numbered among the few ritualists capable of performing the rites of primal summoning, Tozol attempted to call forth the capricious Garuda in the stronghold of Xelphatol.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
