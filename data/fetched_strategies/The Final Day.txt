Wishing to free mankind from his vain struggle, they began to sing, their chorus borne upon the invisible winds of dynamis to usher in the Final Days.Against all odds, you have arrived at their nest at the edge of the universe. In this place, where emotions dictate reality, the hopes of your comrades have opened the way forward, and it falls to you to take the last step. Transforming conviction into strength, you sally forth upon dragonback to confront the Endsinger and silence her song of oblivion.— In-game descriptionThe Final Dayis a level 90trialintroduced inpatch 6.0withEndwalker.Contents1Guide1.1The Endsinger1.1.1Phase 11.1.2Add Phase1.1.3Phase 22Loot3Dialogue4Images5HistoryGuideTrial Guide by MTQcaptureThe EndsingerFalling off the arena is possible. You can useLimit Break3 before the add phase, as it will recharge instantly before Ultimate Fate countdown.Phase 1Elegeia: Raid-wide AoE and spawns two planets circling the arena. Pay attention to the SLOWER moving planet and move away from it as it will spawn a huge AoE on the side of the platform when they collide.Galaxias: The Endsinger drops a meteor in the middle, creating a knockback. Move to the middle so you're knocked back only halfway and do not fall off of the platform.  If you have an anti-knockback skill, be sure to use it.Elenchos: The Endsinger will spawn one of two possible attacks:If her MOUTH GLOWS purple - a line AoE will shoot through the middle --> Move to the sides.If her EYES TEAR down her face in purple streaks - two line AoEs will shoot out on the sides --> Move to the middle.Death's Embrace: Targets players with narrow cone AoE that follows the player when they move. Spread these out; DO NOT OVERLAP with other party members. Right after this attack a couple of adds called "Feather of Despair" will drop and start casting Pharmakon. Simply move away from the feathers, as they will spawn circle AoEs at their bases.Aporrhos: Spawns 4 faces similar to that of The Endsinger which will cast a line AoE in the direction they are facing, like the mouth version of Elenchos. Position in between the faces to avoid this attack.Hubris: Tankbuster on both tanks - spread these out as they are AoE attacks. Tanks: pop multiple cooldowns here. Healers: be ready to help heal them through this.Elegeia Unforgotten: Like the original version this is a raid-wide AoE attack, followed by the spawn of two planets that will eventually collide. Watch the SLOWER moving planet for the collision.  The boss will then begin to reconstruct the moon and cast the next spell,... Note: The planets will always explode in the same order if more than one collision is shown.Fatalism: Rewinds the recorded event, will be cast within a Elegeia Unforgotten window.Ekstasis: The Endsinger drops AoE puddles across the platform, these puddles will turn into heads which will in turn drop growing AoE puddles. Position yourself all the way at the edge at cardinal positions to avoid the puddles.Interstellar: Before this attack The Endsinger changes its position and is indicated with the voiceline "'Tis so lonely between the stars". This attack will cleave through the middle so players should move to the sides of the arena, but at the same time it targets four players with an AoE circle. Position yourself so AoEs do not overlap and leave safe space for players without AoEs.Nemesis: Spawns a targetted AoE on every player, spread out to avoid overlapping.Planetes: Begins a cutscene and triggers the Add Phase.Add PhaseThe Endsinger spawns her necklace, Kakodaimon, as an add and slowly begins charging up an purple orb of oblivion along with aDespairgauge bar.Meteor Radiant: Kakodaimon spawns planets on the outside of the arena that signals where they are about to fall through a rainbow-colored arrow. To avoid the AoE simply move away from the location the arrow lands at.Meteor Outburst: Kakodaimon targets every player with an own AoE; spread out to avoid overlapping.Ultimate Fate: Heavy raid-wide damage based on how far theDespairgauge filled. If the Endsinger was allowed to reach 100%, or if the party did not counter in time with atankLimit Break3 and mitigation, this attack will wipe the party.AfterUltimate Fateis withstood, the Endsinger will then cast a secondUltimate Fatethat the players have noLimit Breakto block it with, and seemingly wipe the party, which triggers another cutscene.Phase 2After the cutscene, the party will receive aPrayers of Hopebuff that gains stacks over time, granting significantly increased damage.Telos: Raid-wide AoE.Telomania: This mechanic is a combination of multiple and repeats until you kill The Endsinger. The combination is as following:First part of Telomania consists of four cleaves over the arena, mitigate and heal these as necessary.Second part of Telomania is a raid-wide AoE similar to the one of Telos, however it is not as hard hitting.Lastly, three sets of puddles will spawn under some players. Simply move to avoid getting hit.Loot10Allagan Tomestone of Causality5Allagan Tomestone of ComedyMeteion Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)DialogueZenos: Our hunt ends this day.

For a better first-time experience, an item level sync of 570 was added in patch 6.5. This is the only 8-player level cap trial (current or historical) with an item level sync.TrialsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 20-50)The Bowl of Embers(Hard/Extreme) •The Navel(Hard/Extreme) •The Howling Eye(Hard/Extreme) •The Porta Decumana(The Minstrel's Ballad: Ultima's Bane) •Battle on the Big Bridge•A Relic Reborn: The Chimera•A Relic Reborn: The Hydra•Thornmarch (Hard)/ (Extreme) •TheWhorleater(Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Striking Tree (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Dragon's Neck•Battle in the Big Keep•The Chrysalis•Urth's FountHeavensward(Lv. 53-60)Thok ast Thok (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Limitless Blue (Hard)/ (Extreme) •The Singularity Reactor(The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign) •Containment Bay S1T7(Extreme) •The Final Steps of Faith(The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage) •Containment Bay P1T6(Extreme) •Containment Bay Z1T9(Extreme)Stormblood(Lv. 63-70)The Pool of Tribute(Extreme) •Emanation(Extreme) •The Royal Menagerie(The Minstrel's Ballad: Shinryu's Domain) •The Jade Stoa(Extreme) •Castrum Fluminis(The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain) •The Great Hunt(Extreme) •Hells' Kier(Extreme) •The Wreath of Snakes(Extreme) •Kugane OhashiShadowbringers(Lv. 73-80)The Dancing Plague(Extreme) •The Crown of the Immaculate(Extreme) •The Dying Gasp(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy) •Cinder Drift(Extreme) •Memoria Misera (Extreme)•The Seat of Sacrifice(Extreme) •Castrum Marinum(Extreme) •The Cloud Deck(Extreme)The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal)•The Navel (Unreal)•TheWhorleater(Unreal)Endwalker(Lv. 83-90)The Dark Inside(The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall) •The Mothercrystal(The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call) •The Final Day(The Minstrel's Ballad: Endsinger's Aria) •Storm's Crown(Extreme) •Mount Ordeals(Extreme) •The Voidcast Dais(Extreme) •The Abyssal Fracture(Extreme) •The Gilded ArayaUltima's Bane (Unreal)•Containment Bay S1T7 (Unreal)•Containment Bay P1T6 (Unreal)•Containment Bay Z1T9 (Unreal)•The Singularity Reactor (Unreal)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
