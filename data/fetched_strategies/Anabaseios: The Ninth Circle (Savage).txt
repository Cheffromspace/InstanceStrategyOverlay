Emboldened by Claudien's encouragement to explore the very bounds of “theory,” she listens to your account of the battle with Kokytos with a mixture of scientific interest and artistic curiosity, and as her quill hurriedly scratches across parchment, you can hear the wheels of her mind turning as her “theories” pour onto the page.— In-game descriptionAnabaseios: The Ninth Circle (Savage)is a level 90raidintroduced inpatch 6.4withEndwalker. The raid is also known asP9S.Contents1Phases & Abilities1.1Mythic Creation: Kokytos1.2Strategy2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer3Dialogue4Images5External LinksPhases & AbilitiesAnimated guide by Hector HectorsonLevinstrike strategies by Hector HectorsonMythic Creation:KokytosEach player should be assigned a clock position, with DPS on intercardinals and supports on cardinals, along with light parties. Pairs of players consisting of 1 DPS and 1 support, each with an assigned cardinal and intercardinal, should also be designated.Shortly after engaging the boss, the arena will be surrounded by a purple AoE that will instantly kill anyone who touches it.Failing any mechanic will result in aDamage Downdebuff, as well as other various effects.StrategyGluttony's Augur: high raidwide damage that should be mitigatedRavening: signals phase transition based on boss color. Unlike Normal mode, this will be coupled with raidwide damage (Soul Surge) that should be mitigated.Mage PhaseDuality of Death: Diffusely telegraphed AoE tankbusters hitting the first enmity player with a fire AoE that inflictsFire Resistance Down IIand the second enmity player with a wind AoE that inflictsWind Resistance Down II. The AoEs hit twice, requiring a tank swap or invulnerability cooldowns.Dualspell: The boss will conjure two elements, signaling an upcoming attack. Shortly before the attack resolves, one of the elements will flash on the screen and the boss will say a specific voice line, indicating that element will be amplified in some way.Ice: A donut AoE that leaves the inner two rings of the arena safe. If ice is amplified, only the innermost circle is safe.Fire: Large circular AoEs (Pile Pyre) that target either all DPS or all supports, require two players to split damage, and inflictMagic Vulnerability Up, making overlap lethal. If fire is amplified, the AoEs will become even larger.Lightning: Line AoEs (Thunder III) that target all players and inflictMagic Vulnerability Up, making overlap lethal. If lightning is amplified, the AoEs will become wider.Combo 1: Fire + Ice:Assigned pairs will stack with each other either just inside the inner ring (if ice is amplified) or just inside the second ring (if fire is amplified).Combo 2: Lightning + Ice:The party will spread to their clock positions either just inside the inner ring (if ice is amplified) or just inside the second ring (if lightning is amplified).Combo 3: Fire + Ice:Same as combo 1, but the opposite element will always be amplified.After this introductory mechanic sequence, the boss will release the Mage soul withDisgorge(no cast bar) and castRaveningto transition into its next form.Martialist PhaseAscendant Fist: Telegraphed, heavy-hitting single tankbuster that inflictsConcussion, dealing damage-over-time, andPhysical Vulnerability Up, requiring a tank swap during the cast to prevent lethal damage from subsequent auto-attacks.Four AoEs will then appear on all cardinals or all intercardinals, designating where a barrier will spawn.Archaic Rockbreaker: A purple knockback AoE (Shockwave) will appear in the middle, killing anyone inside it. Pairs of players must be knocked back to the barriers that spawn, as this knockback cannot be prevented with knockback immune actions. After the knockback, either all DPS or all supports will be hit with an untelegraphed split damage AoE that requires two people to soak.Several cracks will appear from the center, and orbs of light will begin traveling through some of the cracks, in two sets. When they reach the end, they will emit a medium-sized circular AoE with a brief telegraph.At the same time, the boss will useFront CombinationorRear Combination, telegraphing either a point-blank or donut AoE (Outside / Inside Roundhouse'), an untelegraphed 180 degree cleave to either its front or rear based on the name of the cast, and finally an untelegraphed point-blank or donut AoE that is opposite of the initially telegraphed AoE. Anyone hit by the 180 degree cleaves will be inflicted withSustained Damage.The final untelegraphed point-blank or donut AoE will coincide with the second set of circular AoEs from the exploding cracks.For example, if the boss usesFront Combinationand telegraphs a donut AoE, the party will dodge first set of exploding cracks, then go behind the boss and outside its hitbox at max melee range to avoid the frontal cleave and untelegraphed point-blank AoE, while dodging the second set of exploding cracks.Archaic Demolish: Untelegraphed split damage AoEs targeting both healers, requiring the party to split into assigned light parties.The boss will use anotherGluttony's Augurraidwide which also removes the barriers,Ascendant Fisttankbuster, then transition to its next form withRavening.Mage + Martialist (Chimera) PhaseFour AoEs will then appear on all cardinals or all intercardinals, designating where a barrier will spawn.Levinstrike Summoning: The boss will summon four lightning orbs in front of the barriers that spawned. Each orb will be numbered 1, 3, 5, and 7, going either clockwise or counterclockwise. In addition, four random players will be numbered 2, 4, 6, and 8.Scrambled Succession: The four players without a number will be sequentially marked with a blue overhead marker. When the cast finishes, the boss will become untargetable and begin a series of mechanics.The boss will teleport to the1marked lightning orb and kick it across the arena until it strikes the barrier, which will cause it to explode in a small AoE (Shock) that should be avoided. Afterwards, a tower will spawn that must be soaked by a player, which will inflictMagic Vulnerability Up, or it will explode and deal massive raidwide damage,Damage Down, andParalysison everyone.The boss will strike the2marked player with a medium circular AoE (Firemeld) that inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up.At the same time, the first player with a blue overhead marker will be hit with a massive circular AoE (Icemeld) that inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up.The boss will repeat this sequence of mechanics for the remaining numbers.To prevent deaths due to the Magic Vulnerability Up timers, the towers need to be soaked by the 6 - 8 - 2 - 4 numbered players in that order. These players must also be isolated from others when they are hit withFiremeldto prevent overlapping other players. The players without numbers will need to be opposite the rest of the party when their blue marker is about to expire to prevent overlapping other players with theirIcemeldAoE.Two Minds: Functions similarly toDualspellwith a random elemental pair and amplifier (Fire + IceorLightning + Ice).The boss will use anotherGluttony's Augurraidwide which also removes the barriers, then transition to its next form withRavening.Behemoth PhaseCharybdis: The boss will summon four large persistent AoEs at all cardinals or all intercardinals.Comet: Four proximity AoEs appear at the cardinals/intercardinals not occupied by a Charybdis AoE, requiring the party to be in the middle of the arena to mitigate the damage. When the AoEs resolve, four rocks will spawn at the AoE locations: two random rocks will be cracked, while the other two will be undamaged.Beastly Bile: Split damage AoE targeted at the furthest player and should be soaked by four players. Note that the AoE will resolve at the same time asThunderbolt.Thunderbolt: Four large conal AoEs targeted at the four closest players.The goal is to resolve the mechanics while protecting the two undamaged rocks, as they will become damaged if they are hit by any of these attacks, likely causing the next mechanic to fail. Four players from one role group (e.g., supports) should stack outside the boss's hitbox on adamaged rockto baitBeastly Bile, which will destroy the meteor, while the four players from the other group should spread inside the hitbox and baitThunderbolttowards the persistent AoEs so they avoid hitting any rocks.The mechanic will repeat, so now the four DPS should baitBeastly Bileon the remaining damaged rocks, while the supports baitThunderbolt.Ecliptic Meteor: A random surviving rock will receive a red marker, indicating where a raidwide meteor AoE will drop that will kill anyone not hiding behind an undamaged rock, specifically blocking line-of-sight with the targeted rock.Beastly Fury: Moderate raidwide damage.The boss will useRaveningagain, summoning barriers on all cardinals or intercardinals.Chimera Phase 2The boss starts with anotherDuality of Deathtankbuster.Archaic Rockbreakeris used again, requiring the party to split into pairs and be knocked to their assigned barrier, then take the split damage AoE.The two sets of exploding crack AoEs will appear again. However, the boss will combine this with aDualspell(alwaysFire and Ice). Players will dodge both sets of AoEs, then go to their partner stack spots depending on whether Fire or Ice is amplified.Gluttony's Auguris used again, removing the barriers.Chimeric Succession: The four furthest players will be marked 1-4, indicating they will be hit with a massive circular AoE (Icemeld), requiring them to be isolated from others.Front/Rear Firestrikes: A stack AoE that targets a random unmarked player and deals proximity damage, requiring the players baiting this to be far enough away to mitigate the damage taken.Swinging Kick: A 180 degree cleave in front of the boss (ifFront Firestrikes) or behind the boss (ifRear Firestrikes).Two Mindsis used again with a random elemental combination and amplifier.The boss will useRaveningagain and transition to its mage form again.Final PhasesOnly repeat mechanics for the remainder of the fight.Duality of DeathDualspell(random)Gluttony's AugurRavening(transition to Chimera)Disintegration:Enrage.The boss must be defeated before this cast finishes or the party will wipe.Loot1Anabaseios Mythos I(Guaranteed)Treasure CofferNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAscension Earring Coffer (IL 660)OtherN/AABasic1Ascension Necklace Coffer (IL 660)OtherN/AABasic1Ascension Bracelet Coffer (IL 660)OtherN/AABasic1Ascension Ring Coffer (IL 660)OtherN/AABasic1DialogueAll lines from the boss are voice acted.Kokytos:Eat, fight...
