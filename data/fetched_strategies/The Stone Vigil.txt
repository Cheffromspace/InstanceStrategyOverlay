The following years have seen the knights of House Durendaire make several attempts at reclaiming the fortress, but to no avail.

He has powerful frontal breath attacks that all players besides the tank should avoid. One strategy is to only have the tank stand in front of Chudo-Yudo, rest of the party members stand behind the dragon at all times. By staying out of his breath attacks, the fight should be fairly easy.All non-tanks stand behind the dragon at all times.AbilitiesRakeis an instant melee attack that deals a small amount of damage.Lion's Breathis a casted breath attack that deals a moderate amount of damage and inflictsBurnson all targets hit.Swingeis a frontal AoE cone attack that deals a moderate amount of damage and inflicts the debuffsSilenceandPacificationfor 5 seconds on all targets hit.KoshcheiKoshchei is the 2nd dragon boss of The Stone Vigil. This fight was updated inpatch 6.1, modifying the arena shape and appearance as well as making mechanics more consistent with the conventions that have developed in the game since this dungeon's initial release.  Typhoon is the main mechanic of this fight; it requires players to reposition into safe zones to avoid tornadoes that move in straight lines down the length of the arena dealing moderate damage to any players caught in their path.  They move fairly slowly and staying out of their way is fairly simple.Returning players should be aware that the updates to this fight are extensive and mostly have the effect of vastly simplifying the battle.AbilitiesSpiked Tailis this boss's tankbuster.  All other party members should steer clear of the tank.Sonic Stormis a circular AoE targeted on a random party member.  Dodge out of the AoE indicator.Typhoonspawns three whirlwinds at the back of the arena the first time it is cast and four thereafter.  For the first cast, simply move to the empty lane to avoid the whirlwinds. In the second cast and all following it, when two whirlwinds begin to move players should stand in front of one that is still stationary. Once the first two have gone past, dodge behind them into the safe space created to avoid the second pair.  Which two move first is random, so keep an eye on them when they spawn to determine how to react.IsgebindIsgebind is the final boss of The Stone Vigil. The fight was also revamped forpatch 6.1, though not as extensively as the battle with Koshchei.  This icy dragon has powerful breath attacks along with massive AoE capabilities. Non-tank party members should stay away from the front of the dragon to avoid its breath attacks.Throughout the fight, Isgebind will take flight and a strip about a third of the room in width will glow with a icy blue light. After a few seconds Isegebind will fly over the area and use its frost breath. Players caught in the area will take damage and the debuffFrostbitefor moderate damage over time. Squishier players (e.g. healers and ranged DPS) can be killed instantly by this, so be careful. Stand near the middle and be prepared to run toward one side.  However, when Isegebind returns to the arena, players should move out of the center to avoid being squished by its Touchdown attack.Be sure to avoid glowy blue areas when they appear.One major change that returning players should be aware of is that the AoE from Sheets of Ice no longer persists as it did pre-6.1.  Parties can be a bit more mobile than they once were as the space available for dodging Cauterize will no longer be affected by Sheets of Ice placement.AbilitiesRime Wreathis an ice ability that damages all players for moderate amount of damage.Frost Breathis a frontal cone AoE attack that deals heavy damage to all targets hit.Sheet of Iceis circular AoE that targets a random player. It deals a moderate amount of damage and inflicts the debuffFrostbite.  The AoE can be avoided if the affected player moves quickly.Cauterizeis an ability that turns about a third of the room an icy blue color. After a few seconds, Isgebind flies over the area and deals damage and inflicts the debuffFrostbiteto all targets in area.  After the third Cauterize attack, Sheet of Ice AoEs will target all players two times in a row before Isgebind returns.  With the 6.1 update, positioning during this double attack is not as important as it once was, but the party should be sure to avoid stacking.  Dodge out of these circular AoEs as before.Touchdownis used after Cauterize. Isgebind crashes to the ground in the center of the arena, dealing small amount of damage to all players nearby.BestiaryNameDropsCarrier ZizChudo-YudoDravanian OutflyerDravanian OutwalkerNameDropsIce SpriteIsgebindKoshcheiLootSee also:Vigil WeaponsandVigil ArmorChudo-YudoNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAncient SwordGladiator's Arm43BGreen1Ars AlmadelArcanist's Grimoire43BGreen1Ars NotoriaScholar's Arm43BGreen1Blue SteelMachinist's Arm43BGreen1CapellaAstrologian's Arm43BGreen1Dryad CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm43BGreen1EisentaenzerMarauder's Arm43BGreen1JamadharsPugilist's Arm43BGreen1JambiyasRogue's Arm43BGreen1Keep of SaintsTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm43BGreen1LockheartDark Knight's Arm43BGreen1Shadow BowArcher's Arm43BGreen1Vigil Canopus ShieldShield43BGreen1Wyvern SpearLancer's Arm43BGreen1KoshcheiNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityVigil CoifHead43BGreen1Vigil CuffsHands43BGreen1Vigil EyepatchHead43BGreen1Vigil HatHead43BGreen1Vigil HaubergeonBody43BGreen1Vigil RingbandsHands43BGreen1Vigil RobeBody43BGreen1Vigil SarouelLegs43BGreen1Vigil ShirtBody43BGreen1Vigil SkirtLegs43BGreen1Vigil TightsLegs43BGreen1Vigil VambracesHands43BGreen1IsgebindBlue Dragon Card(Drops at a fixed rate)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityArs AlmadelArcanist's Grimoire43BGreen1Ars NotoriaScholar's Arm43BGreen1Blue SteelMachinist's Arm43BGreen1CapellaAstrologian's Arm43BGreen1Cold Salvation Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Dryad CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm43BGreen1EisentaenzerMarauder's Arm43BGreen1Ishgardian Steel IngotMaterialN/AABasic1JamadharsPugilist's Arm43BGreen1JambiyasRogue's Arm43BGreen1Keep of SaintsTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm43BGreen1LockheartDark Knight's Arm43BGreen1Paladin's Ancient Arms (Lv. 41)OtherN/ABGreen1Shadow BowArcher's Arm43BGreen1Vigil BootsFeet43BGreen1Vigil PattensFeet43BGreen1Vigil SolleretsFeet43BGreen1Wyvern SpearLancer's Arm43BGreen1Treasure CoffersTreasure Coffer 1 (X: 12.3 Y: 12.3)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityVigil SolleretsFeet43BGreen1Vigil BootsFeet43BGreen1Vigil PattensFeet43BGreen1Ishgardian Steel IngotMaterialN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 11.0 Y: 10.8)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityVigil CoifHead43BGreen1Vigil EyepatchHead43BGreen1Vigil HatHead43BGreen1Vigil VambracesHands43BGreen1Vigil CuffsHands43BGreen1Vigil RingbandsHands43BGreen1Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 10.7 Y: 8.4)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityVigil HaubergeonBody43BGreen1Vigil ShirtBody43BGreen1Vigil RobeBody43BGreen1Vigil SkirtLegs43BGreen1Vigil SarouelLegs43BGreen1Vigil TightsLegs43BGreen1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the following achievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Stone Vigil10Discover every location withinthe Stone Vigil.-2.0ImagesLoreWatchman Of The Holy SeeOne of four watchtowers built to serve the Holy See of Ishgard in its war against dragonkind, the Stone Vigil forms a defensive line with the Steel Vigil across the Sea of Clouds, the pair flanking the city as stalwart sentinels. Following the Calamity, however, it was overrun and occupied by Nidhogg’s Horde, their presence a sharpened claw upon Ishgard’s bared throat.Under orders from the Vault, House Durendaire commenced a siege to retake the fortress, stationing their knights at Whitebrim Front, but the years passed with nary any progress and the Dravanians remained firmly entrenched.Prior to these events, seeking to give battle to their enemy in the sky, Ishgard had engaged the assistance of the Garlond Ironworks to develop airships. Hangars were constructed in the Vigil in preparation, and it was there that Cid Garlond left his craft, the Enterprise, before the Battle of Carteneau.IsgebindA dragon of Nidhogs’ brood, Isgebind led the main host of the assault on the Stone Vigil. After the stronghold's capture, he was given its command and charged with keeping Ishgard in check. Possessing peerless mastery over ice magicks, he could draw great power from the frigid climes of Coerthas.Retaking The VigilWith the heretic in their midst unmasked, the knights of House Duren- daire were free once more to fix their sights outward—toward the Stone Vigil. Led by the veteran knight Lord Drillemont, the host succeeded in breaching the gate to find a lodgment within the Vigil, but they could make no further inroads against the enemy’s determined defense.In seeking to break this deadlock, Drillemont turned to a familiar face— the adventurer who had earlier lent his strength against the heretics. While certain faction in Ishgard championed foreign cooperation, that a retainer of the conservative House Durendaire should entreat an outsider’s aid was highly irregular. Indeed, the decision to do so was the old knight’s alone, made without consulting his superiors. Having been made to know the adventurer’s worth, however, he harbored no doubt that his faith was well placed. And this faith would be repaid with a great prize: the Stone Vigil’s liberation.GiruveganausAppearing  to be dragons, these creatures were in fact heretics transformed by the secret properties of dragon blood. Others still became syrictae and aevis and their stationing en masse at the Stone Vigil was a result of their defense of their own territory. These transformations were brought about by the secret properties of dragon blood. Others still, were created by the mad alchemists of the heretics, and like their dragon masters, they took to the skies to repel intruders. These minions, however, had no answer to another man-made creation—a airship—and they yielded to the Ishgardians a critical foothold within the Vigil.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
