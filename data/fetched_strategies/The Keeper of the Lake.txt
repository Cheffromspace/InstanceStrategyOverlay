Keep your distance from the glowing red tanks to avoid the large circle attacks around them. After the first tanks explode, more may begin to glow, so be sure to avoid those as well.Mark XLT Quick-firing cannon: At the same time, Einhander will fire a line Aoe that causes at least two of the tanks to glow and explode.Heavy Swing: TankbusterMagitek GunshipFlame Thrower: The gunship will periodically target a player with Flame Thrower, a large frontal cone attack. This attack lasts for several seconds, so get out of the attack marker and stay out of the flame area to avoid damage.Carpet Bomb: Circular AoEThe boss will periodically summons adds that should be dealt with so players can refocus on taking down the gunship.The Gunship also goes across the arena and leaves behind temporary fire puddles that leave aBurnsdebuff if walked into.MidgardsormrUnlike most bosses, his name is replaced with "???" in Duty Information for spoiler purposes.Admonishment: A very wide line attack from the boss.Disgust: Unavoidable raidwide damage.Inner Turmoil: A close-range attack centered on the boss.Outer Turmoil: A donut attack where the safe area is near the boss.Phantom Kin: The boss summons two untargetable Mirage Dragons.

As the dragons are now targetable, they must be defeated before the gauge reaches 100%, in which caseAnimadversionwill wipe the party.Akh Morn: This is the first time players will see a multi-stack marker, which results in multiple attacks instead of just once. Be sure to stay stacked until the attacks stop.Antipathy: An expanding attack, starting as a circle of fire in the center, followed by a ring around the first circle, then a larger ring around that. Stand on the middle ring, then go into the center as soon as the flames have disappeared from the center.Condescension: TankbusterAt this point, the mechanics repeat themselves until the boss is

EnterwinedFifteen years ago, in the skies above Silvertear Falls, the invading forces of the XIVth Legion were set upon by a host of dragons. Leading the charge was Midgardsormr, legendary king of kings, who engaged the Garlean flagship, the Agrius, in battle. In the end, both Midgardsormr and his foe fell to the earth, and their tangled remnants stand as a memorial to that day—a ruined airship, and the charred corpse of the wyrm lord who brought it low, forever devoid of life...or so it seemed.Fearing that Midgardsormr was on the cusp of resurrection, the Ishgard- ians entreated the aid of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who sent the Warrior of Light to investigate the creature’s remains at the Keeper of the Lake. At the structure’s apex, the hero encountered the specter of the fallen wyrm lord, their meeting triggering a chain of events that would shine the light of truth upon the thousand-year conflict known as the Dragonsong War.EinhanderThis monstrous cloudkin has made its nest inside the Keeper of the Lake. Possessed of supe- rior intelligence it has reportedly learned to coordinate its hindlimbs to deftly wield imperial weaponry as hunting implements.MidgardsormrThose who bore witness to the Battle of Silvertear Skies describe the Father of Dragons soaring into battle with a majesty belying his tremendous size. Coiling himself around the Agrius in a deathly embrace, he laid ruin to his metallic foe, but was griev-ously wounded in the ensuing ceruleum explosion and has not since stirred.MoreCut off from the Garlean motherland, the remnants of the XIVth Imperial Legion ventured into the wreck of the Agrius in search of salvage. But the troops would find more than they bargained for, for a band of adventurers had come to investi- gate the Keeper of the Lake, leading to an unexpected skirmish.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
