Fortuitously, one appears to have presented itself: an anonymous missive from an individual seeking the aid of the warrior who laid low the Lord of the Revel. But before they will divulge the details, they would put your abilities to the proof. To wit, you are to venture into the hidden depths of Hells' Lid, a volcanic island once home to a host of oni─at least, according to ancient legend...— In-game descriptionHells' Lidis a level 70dungeonintroduced inpatch 4.2withStormblood.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Otake-maru2.2Kamaitachi2.3Genbu3Loot3.1Otake-maru3.2Kamaitachi3.3Genbu3.4Additional Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 11.9 Y: 12.2)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 11.8 Y: 9.9)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 12.5 Y: 6.5)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 12.6 Y: 4.5)3.4.4.1Miss List4Achievements5Images5.1Gear Images5.2Dungeon Images6Lore6.1An Island Of Legend6.2Otake-maru6.3Kamaitachi6.4MoreObjectivesArrive at Demonsgate.Clear Demonsgate.Arrive in the Furnace.Clear the Furnace.Arrive on the Polished Shell.DefeatGenbu.BossesVideo guide by MTQcaptureOtake-maruAbilities100-tonze Swing:Large point blank AoE around Otake.10-tonze Slash:Large cone shaped AoE, directed away from the tank.Grrraaarrrgh:Otake will jump to a player (other than tank) and will follow that player.

LegendEndless rivers of molten lava flow from this volcanic island into the waters of the Ruby Sea, a testament to the incontestable power of nature. Coupled with the plumes of dark smoke which perpetually foul the air, it is not hard to understand why legends arose describing Hells' Lid as the domain of terrible, man-eating oni.The most prominent of these stories is the faerie tale known as the Tale of Tenzen. Under the orders of a king, the samurai Tenzen went forth to Hells' Lid, and with the help of the Four Lords did he drive a host of oni into the sea. Rewarded with treasures untold, he thence journeyed into the mountains with his four companions, there to live out the rest of their years in peace. These days, it is thought that the oni in the tale were likely the Kojin, but rumors suggest that a different truth yet lurks beneath the island’s volatile surface.Some claim that it was not demons which Tenzen went to slay, but an auspice known as Koryu. And that in failing to fully vanquish the beast, he instead sealed it away in the depths of Hells' Lid. Some also say that Reisen Temple, built by the Four Lords, exists to preserve the wards which cage this most dangerous of prisoners.Otake-maruWithin the depths of Hells' Lid crouches an enormous oni of magical origin, created to give credence to the Tale of Tenzen and thereby conceal the existence of Koryu. A construct manifested by Genbu’s divine power, Otake-maru is charged with chasing off any who wander into his domain.KamaitachiThe Four Lords count many auspices under their rule, and they are said to watch each other closely for signs of growing madness. There have been reports in the Ruby Sea and in Yanxia of “Kamaitachi,” a long, sinuous creature of pale color who may yet be another such mystical beast.MoreAn artist’s depiction of Reisen Temple, based on hearsay and conjecture. An investigation discovered that these rumors originated from the Kojin settlement, Tamamizu, but found no proof of their veracity.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
