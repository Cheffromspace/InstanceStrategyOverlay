Now that the city is free from the threat of the Lightwardens, researchers have been afforded the opportunity to explore the innermost reaches of the tower, though they soon found their way barred by hordes of ferocious guardians. An aetherial disturbance detected from inside is believed to be in some way linked to their appearance, and you have been tasked with not only clearing a path for the researchers, but with investigating the cause of the anomaly.— In-game descriptionThe Twinningis a level 80dungeonintroduced inpatch 5.0withShadowbringers.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1Alpha Zaghnal2.2Mithridates2.3Artificial Enigma: The Tycoon3Loot3.1Alpha Zaghnal3.2Mithridates3.3Artificial Enigma: The Tycoon3.4Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 16.5 Y: 14.9)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 15.4 Y: 13.6)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 11.1 Y: 9.1)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 11.3 Y: 6.8)4Lore5Trivia6Achievements7Images7.1Gear Images7.2Dungeon ImagesObjectivesArrive at Repurposing: 0/1Clear Repurposing: 0/1Arrive at Aetherial Observation: 0/1Clear Aetherial Observation: 0/1Arrive at Cornice: 0/1Defeatthe Tycoon: 0/1BossesVideo guide by MTQcaptureAlpha ZaghnalAugurium:Tankbuster.

players can find notes left behind that provide insight into the Ironworks's efforts to save The Source.“Our only hope lies in the Crystal Tower, though it did not yield its secrets easily. Even opening the doors was a monumental undertaking. Without the founder's datalogs and the NOAH reports left by the Sons of Saint Coinach, we would never have stood a chance of succeeding.None of us were prepared for the spectacle that awaited us when we first stepped into the tower. To be surrounded by the marvels of a lost age took our breath away. And there, at its center, we found him.— Ironworks Datalog 2.5“Our research into the Emperor's Throne is almost complete, as we now understand the methods used to open a doorway to the World of Darkness, otherwise known as the Thirteenth.However, this is only the beginning of our plan. Even if we find a way to the First, it is already too late to prevent the Eighth Umbral Calamity. For that, we must travel not only to another world, but to another time.Thankfully, the datalogs gathered over the years, detailing battles with various primals, pointed us in the right direction.— Ironworks Datalog 3.5“Just as we thought the pieces were in place, we came to the realization that traversing time and space has its... difficulties. It is one thing to possess the technology necessary to enable such a feat, quite another to actually perform it.The interdimensional rift, as it was called in the founder's datalogs, is what I can only describe as "infinite chaos." To navigate it would take expertise far beyond our ken.There was, however, once a being capable of exactly that: The one known as "Omega." And yet, despite all of the research carried out, the mystery of how it was able to cross the rift remains unsolved.— Ironworks Datalog 4.5TriviaThe track that plays in the overworld (The Long Fall) is a remix of both Syrcus Tower and eScape from the Omega raids in Stormblood.The track that plays during the battle with the Tycoon (Locus - The Primals) is a remix of "Locus" from the Alexander raids in Heavensward.The Ironworks datalog numbers are the same patches that introduced their subject material: 2.5 refers to theSons of Saint Coinach, 3.5 referencesThe Thirteenthandtime travel, and 4.5 referencesOmega.During the cinematic following The Tycoon's defeat, a faded version ofBiggs (or more likely his descendantmentioned in the cutscene with Bethana after completion) can be seen standing off to the left.AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: The Twinning10Discover every location withinthe Twinning.-5.0ImagesGear ImagesDungeon ImagesDungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
