Before the fight, players should split into four pairs of two, with tanks and healers partnering with a DPS each, and then assigning spread positions on the intercardinals (IE northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast). Next, players should determine one of those pairs who will move inwards to the center of the spread groups for a later mechanic, as well as spread positions around a semicircle. Finally, players will need to create two light parties, with a tank, healer and two DPS. Most sources of avoidable damage will result in aDamage Downdebuff, as well as other various effects. Most sources of unavoidable damage will result in a shortVulnerability Updebuff that will cause lethal damage if players are hit by more than one mechanic at a time.AbilitiesThe boss's auto-attacks will target the first and second highest enmity players at the same time.Spark of Life: Unavoidable raidwide AoE that deals high damage, requiring mitigation. InflictsBleed.Dispersed Aero II: Targets the first and second highest enmity players with a high damage tankbuster AoE. Inflicts aWindburndebuff that deals damage over time.Condensed Aero II: A shared tankbuster AoE that targets the highest enmity player. Inflicts aWindburndebuff that deals damage over time.Blades of Attis: Summons multiple medium-sized AoEs that move slowly in a straight line across the arena based on the arrow telegraph.Immortal's Obol: Places a proximity damage marker in the center of the arena, and creates three safe areas for players to stand. When the attack finishes, the boss destroys the arena, and anyone not in a safe zone or too close to the center dies immediately.Forbidden Fruit: Summons various yellow eggs to the arena, that transform into different adds, each with a different effect. Note that neither the eggs nor the adds can be targeted.Egg with Teeth: Transforms into anImmature Minotaur, which will perform one of two attacks depending on whether it tethers players.Bullish Swipe (no tether):Turns towards to the nearest player and telegraphs two wide conal AoE aimed at the two nearest players, which will shortly resolve.Bullish Slash (tether):Will tether one player. The single tethered player will be hit with a wide conal AoE, dealing proximity-based damage as seen by the tether visual, and inflicting  aVulnerability Updebuff.Egg with Eyes: Transforms into anImmature Io, which will perform one of two attacks depending on whether it tethers players.Static Moon (no tether):A circular AoE attack that fills one of the smaller platforms, making it unsafe to stand on.Static Path (tethers):Will tether four players, either all DPS or all tanks and healers. Each tethered player will be hit with a large line AoE that inflicts high damage and aVulnerability Updebuff.Egg with Scales: Transforms into anImmature Stymphalide, which will perform one of two attacks depending on whether it tethers players. The direction each add is facing is indicated by an orange marker.Stymphalian Strike (no tether):The add will use a large line AoE attack in front of itself.Bronze Bellows (tethers):Will tether one player. The add will dash in a straight line towards them, inflicting high damage, a knockback that can be mitigated with knockback immune abilities, andVulnerability Up.Hemitheos's Holy III: targets both healers with a stack marker.Bough of Attis: The boss hits either the front of the arena, dealing lethal damage, then slides one of its arms forward, knocking players from the arena, or the rear of the arena, dealing lethal damage. Both attacks debuff withDown for the Count, stunning any players hit.Inviolate Bonds: All players will be inflicted with eitherInviolate Winds, which drops a small AoE under the player,Holy Bonds, a stack mechanic, or both. Both markers also have either aIorII, indicating what order they will resolve. Players will receive these debuffs based on role (tanks/ healers or DPS), so tanks and healers may receiveInviolate Windswith aI, meaning their debuffs will resolve first, while the DPS receiveInviolate Windswith aII, meaning they will spread out second. One player from both roles will also receive aHoly BondsIandII, which work in the same way. The name of this debuff does not indicate its order, so players will have to check their debuff list.Roots of Attis: A telegraphed AoE in which the boss will break one or multiple of the bridges connecting the smaller arenas. Standing on the bridge when this happens will kill the player.Multicast: The boss will cast bothHemitheos's Aero IV, a massive knockback, andHemitheos's Holy, a high damage AoE dropped on each player that also inflicts a shortVulnerability Updebuff.Burst (no castbar): The boss calls four meteor circles to the arena, which each require a player to stand in to mitigate damage. If a circle is empty, the raid will take massive damage (Big Burst).Inviolate Purgation: All players will be debuffed withPurgatory Winds,Holy Purgation, or both. Each player will receive two differently numberedPurgatory Winds, while four players will each receive a differently numberedHoly Purgation. This attack functions the same asInviolate Bonds, except each player will have two sets ofWindsto handle, and two sets ofHoly. The debuffs also drop massive circular AoEs (Hemitheos's Tornado) when they resolve that will detonate shortly afterwards. AoEs dropped byHemitheos's Holywill be donut AoEs.Light of Life: a high damage raidwide AoE, requiring mitigation. Later serves as the hard enrage cast.Hemitheos's Glare: All players will be marked and be followed by a large AoE for a short time.Famine's Harvest: Two eggs will spawn on each platform, and two off the edges. Players will have to handle the mechanics of the adds that spawn from the eggs (2Immature Stymphalideswithout tethers, 2Immature Minotaurswithout tethers, 4Immature Minotaurswith tethers).Death's Harvest: Five eggs will spawn on the platforms and bridges, and players will need to handle the mechanics appropriately (2Immature Stymphalideswithout tethers, 1Immature Iowithout tethers, 2Immature Iowith tethers).War's Harvest: Five eggs will spawn on the platforms and bridges, and players will need to position appropriately (2Immature Minotaurswith tethers, 2Immature Stymphalideswith tethers, 1Immature Iowith tethers).StrategyThe boss will start with a strong raidwide AoE that deals aBleeddebuff which needs to be mitigated and healed through. The boss will then use a tankbuster, eitherDispersed Aero II, and AoE requiring the tanks to move away from each other and the party, orCondensed Aero II, requiring the tanks to share the attack. Both versions deal high damage and aWindburndebuff. Which attack comes out is completely random, so tanks will have to be ready to move. Following this the boss will useBlades of Attis, calling three sets of moving AoEs to the outside of the platform. Players should identify which AoEs are moving across the arena on a diagonal and move into where they fired from after the AoE has fired twice. This will come along withImmortal's Obol, so players will need to move to one of the safe zones on the arena.Once the arena reforms and theBladeshave resolved, the boss will castForbidden Fruit, summoning twoImmature Stymphalideand anImmature Io. At the same time the boss will castBough of Attis, targeting the south platform andHemitheos's Holy IIIon the healers. Players need to identify where theIois, as that platform is not safe to stand on. TheImmature Stymphalidewill both fire their AoEs through one of the platforms, so players will need to stand in the intercardinals of the platform in a tight grouping to avoid the attacks, while also standing stacked for the healers. The boss will use another tankbuster, thenSpark of Life. Healers should be ready to take care of the main tank, as they can be taking a lot of damage.The boss will then castInviolate Bonds, inflicting all players with debuffs. Players will need to check the order theirWindsandHolydebuffs fire in. Players who have aIon their debuff will take their spread positions, while the rest of the group stacks in the middle to handle theHolystack. Immediately after, the players withIIon their debuff will swap places with them, handling the attacks the same way. Note that these debuffs are assigned by role: either the tanks/healers or all DPS will spread while the other role group spreads in the first debuff set, followed by the opposite in the second debuff set. The boss will also useBough of Attis, attacking the front platforms then sliding its hand across them, so players will have to move to the new safe platform before the second set of debuffs fire. Following this, the boss will useRoots of Attisand destroy the northern bridge, so players will need to move to one of the other platforms. The boss will use another tankbuster, so tanks should break away from their group and head to the southern platform to handle the mechanics, then move back.The boss will use anotherForbidden Fruitwhile also castingMulticast. The threeImmature Stymphalidewill each fire over one of the bridges, so players simply need to avoid those attacks. For handlingMulticast, players should be spread out to avoid theHemitheos's Holythat drops a large AoE on each player, and pop knockback resistance to handle theHemitheos's Aero IV. These attacks will resolve at roughly the same time, so positioning is key. The boss will useRoots of Attisonce again, so players should move off the bridges and into their light parties on two separate platforms. The boss will use anotherForbidden Fruitand summon threeImmature Io's, while also marking healers for stacks. Players will need to wait by the edge of the platforms to move immediately on to the bridges that spawn to avoid theIo'sattacks, staying in their groups to mitigate the stack.The boss will use anotherBough of Attis, and players will have to watch which hand will move forward. Another tankbuster, thenForbidden Fruit, summoning anImmature Ioon one platform, and threeImmature Minotaurson the other two platforms and in the center of the bridge. Each player will tether to one of the ads. Players who tether to theIomust move to its platform and spread out in a semi-circle and face towards the center of the bridge to ensure the line AoE from the ad fires away from other players. The players who tether to theMinotaursmust move away until their tethers turn purple, and the untethered players must bait the conal AoE from theMinotaurin the center of the bridge to fire away from the other platforms, then move to the edge of theIo'splatform to avoid the attacks from the otherMinotaurs. If the tethers of theMinotaursare not purple, the tethered players will take high damage and a massive knockback. Each attack also inflicts a shortVulnerability Up, so getting hit by more than one attack will kill a player.The boss will use anotherBlades of Attis,Hemitheos's Holy IIIandHemitheos's Aero IVas the arena reforms. Players should return to near the middle, stand in their light parties directly to the left and right of the center, then allow the knockback to move them towards theBlades. Players should stay stacked to handle theHoly, then move into theBladesoriginal starting position. The boss will follow up with another tankbuster, then castForbidden Fruit, summoning fourImmature Stymphalidewhile also castingBurstand placing four markers on the intercardinals of the arena. TheImmature Stymphalidewill tether to a player, while the untethered players must stand in the circles. To handle this, tethered players should move to the opposite side of the arena from theirImmature Stymphalideand use a knockback immunity skill as they see the orbs getting close to the circles to prevent other players from getting clipped by their attack. Once this resolves, the boss will use anotherSpark of Life, then anotherImmortal's Obol, transforming the arena once again.The boss will cast anotherForbidden Fruit, summoning twoImmature Stymphalideand anImmature Io, as well as castingInviolate Purgation, giving debuffs to players. To handle these mechanics, players will first identify which platform theImmature Iospawned on, as that platform cannot be used. Players will start  at the northwest platform; if that is unsafe, they will go the northeast platform. The first set of debuffs will begin resolving. The player withHoly Iwill go to one waymark, along with players with noIdebuffs. Meanwhile, the four players withAero Idebuffs will spread to the other three waymarks and the center of the platform, to form a trapezoidal arrangement. Note that for each of the four debuff sets, only one role group (tanks/healers or all dps) will spread, while the other will stack. After the debuffs resolve, the party will move to the other (northwest or northeast) platform and repeat the stacks/spreads with theIIdebuffs. The boss will then finish castingLight of Life, an unavoidable raidwide AoE, so healers will need to be mitigating and healing while moving. This mechanic repeats for theIIIandIVdebuffs, followed by a secondLight of Life.The boss will use anotherForbidden Fruit, calling twoImmature Stymphalideto the platforms, leaving one open. The boss will also castHemitheos's Glare, targeting all players with a large AoE that will follow them slowly, then useRoots of Attisto destroy the bridges. Players should stack on the edge of the empty platform out of the line AoE of theImmature Stymphalideto bait the AoEs, then move towards the platform with theImmature Stymphalidethat isn't facing their platform. The bridges will reform in time for players to move across them. Players will simply move to the center of the other platform to avoid the AoEs.The boss will then castFamine's Harvest, summoning twoImmature Stymphalideand sixImmature Minotaursto the platforms. TheImmature Stymphalidewill fire their line AoEs, while four of theImmature Minotaurswill tether to players, and the last two will turn towards players and fire a conal AoE. To handle these mechanics, players will determine which platform only has theImmature Minotaurson it, as they are the ones who won't tether. Untethered players will move to that platform and bait the AoEs off the edge away from the other players while also standing in the safe zones from theImmature Stymphalide. The other players will move to the opposite platform to their tethered ads and spread to either side of the platforms to avoid overlapping their attacks. All attacks will fire at the same time. Each hit also debuffs with a shortVulnerability Up, so overlapping attacks will kill players.The boss will follow up withDeath's Harvest, summoning threeImmature Io'sand twoImmature Stymphalide. TheIo'son the bridges will tether to players, while theIoon the platform will perform its AoE, and theImmature Stymphalidewill fire line AoEs in the direction they are facing. To handle this, players tethered to theImmature Ioon the southwestern bridge will move to the northwestern platform and spread in a semi-circle behind theImmature Stymphalidead, while the players tethered to theImmature Ioon the northern bridge will move to the northeastern platform behind theImmature Stymphalide. Again, players need to spread sufficiently to avoid overlap. All attacks will fire at the same time, and players should move to the northern bridge for healing.The boss will castWar's Harvest, summoning two each of theImmature MinotaurandImmature Stymphalide, and oneImmature Io. All ads will tether to players. The players tethered to theImmature Ioshould move to its platform and spread behind it as before, the players tethered to theImmature Stymphalideshould move to the southern platform and spread apart to avoid overlapping, and the players tethered to theImmature Minotaursshould move to the opposite edge of the northwestern platform, spreading to avoid overlap. Though the tethers won't turn purple, players will survive as long as they have some form of mitigation. Once again, these attacks will all resolve at the same time. All players should then meet at the southern platform to heal and mitigate theSpark of Lifethat is coming.Players will then break into their light parties to mitigate aHemitheos's Holy III, then move to the platform opposite where the boss'sBough of Attiswill cleave, then players simply need to burn the boss down before enrage, as it will cast twoSpark of Life, then a slowcastLight of Lifeas the enrage. If players can't defeat the boss before the cast completes, they will wipe.Loot1Abyssos Mythos III(Guaranteed)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAbyssos Leg Gear Coffer (IL 630)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityMoonshine BrineOtherN/AABasic1Moonshine TwineOtherN/AABasic1Abyssos Head Gear Coffer (IL 630)OtherN/AABasic1Abyssos Hand Gear Coffer (IL 630)OtherN/AABasic1Abyssos Foot Gear Coffer (IL 630)OtherN/AABasic1ImagesHistoryInPatch 6.25, the arena was changed to be enlarged after completing the duty, allowing players to place waymarks in areas that were previously inaccessible. This change was in response to a very popular set of waymarks used forInviolate Purgationbut were originally created using a third-party tool to allow waymark placement in areas not on solid ground. Specifically, the three-platform arena orientation extends outside the range of the large circular arena at the start of the battle, which prevented waymark placement on areas that would become the outside of the platforms.The change also applies to the Normal mode.External LinksCommon party finder strategies for P7S - Aether/NARaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
