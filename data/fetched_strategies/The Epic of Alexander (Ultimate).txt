Inspired by this tragic tale of a mechanical god who placed his trust in a single mortal soul, the wandering minstrel spreads the proverbial wings of imagination and takes flight, weaving an impassioned ballad of hope and despair profound.— In-game descriptionThe Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)is a level 80ultimate raidintroduced inpatch 5.11withShadowbringers.

(They will all spawn on cardinals or all on intercardinals.) TheLiquid Ragetornados will each spawn on a large puddle that will inflictDropsyto any player who steps in it, which will kill them. This damage-over-time effect can be neutralized with tank invulnerabilities and will dissipate when the player leaves the puddle.Liquid Hand: The boss will split its current HP and summon this add. While it does not need to be defeated, players must pay attention to its HP in order to handle a mechanic later.Hand of Prayer/Parting: Based on where the hand and the boss are, the hand will glow and either form a fist or be an open palm. If the boss is far from the hand, it will be an open palm. If the hand forms a fist, the boss and the hand need to be separated. If the hand is an open palm, the boss and the hand must be brought together. Failing this mechanic will wipe the raid.Hand of Pain: This acts as a check that happens periodically. If the boss and the hand's HP are more than 4% different by the end of the cast, the party wipes instantly. Players must keep both the boss and the Hand in check during the entire phase.Protean Wave: Conal AoEs that fire from the boss and theLiquid Rages. TheLiquid Rageswill each use a telegraphed AoE aimed at the nearest player that must be avoided, followed by an untelegraphed AoE that will hit the nearest player. The boss will use telegraphed AoEs aimed at all players that must be avoided, followed by two sets of untelegraphed AoEs that will each hit the four nearest players. When the boss fires waves, it will also fire one directly out in front of where it's facing that isn't telegraphed, so players need to avoid standing directly in front of the boss. Telegraphed Protean Waves will knock any player back and kill them if they are hit. Untelegraphed Protean Waves aimed to the nearest players will inflictWater Resistance Down, which will make another Protean Wave hit lethal until the debuff expires.Jagd Dolls: FourJagd Dolladds will spawn in the middle of the arena slightly off the cardinals. These will tether to the first person who damages them and will pulse a medium-sized circular AoE (Exhaust) occasionally, debuffing with a stackingLuminous Aetheroplasm. Once their HP have been reduced to 25% or less, they must be brought within either the boss's or the Hand's hitbox, causing whoever the add is fed to to castReducible Complexity, dealing moderate raid-wide damage. If the adds are killed or fed with too much health,Reducible Complexitywill wipe the raid. If players get 2 or more stacks ofLuminous Aetheroplasm, they will die.Pressurize/Embolus: Orbs will spawn at two of the Rages and move towards both the boss and Hand were at the time they spawned. If they touch a boss or a player they will explode (Outburst) and wipe the raid.Sluice: The boss will spawn these telegraphed circular AoEs under the four players that are the furthest away from it.Splash: A non-telegraphed attack that blasts the raid with moderate unavoidable damage six times in a row. Mitigate and heal through.Drainage: Two random Rages will send out tethers. Tanks need to pick these up and use cooldowns to mitigate the damage that comes out from them.Throttle: 6 random players will be debuffed withThrottle, which needs to be dispelled withEsunaorThe Warden's Paean, otherwise the players will die at the resolution of the debuff.Strategy:To start, pull the boss to the middle and face to the north. The boss will useFluid Swingand follow withCascade, spawning the threeLiquid RagesNote where these spawn and mitigate the attacks with cooldowns. It is recommended that players top up HP here. The boss will then split its HP and summon theLiquid Handhere. Keeping the boss close to the Hand is a good idea so they can both be AoE'd and damage can be managed easier on both. Keeping them close together will baitHand of Partinglater.Have the off tank pick up the Hand and separate them once theHand ofattack comes out. Players will need to then position for theProtean Waves. The ranged and healers should bait these so they fire out of the arena. Following this, theJagd Dollswill spawn. They will spawn in relation to where theLiquid Ragesare, so the DPS players who are picking up the Dolls should be sure which one they are picking up. The boss will useHand of Painhere, so be sure to have the boss and the Hand at roughly the same HP, with no more than a 4% variance. At this time, the Rages will spawn Embolus, which will start to move towards where the Hand and the boss were at the time of spawning. The tanks need to move the boss and the Hand away to make sure they don't touch the orbs. Just before that, the boss and the Hand will useFluid Strike/Swing, which need to be mitigated. After this the tanks can move the boss and the Hand.Players can then feed theirJagd Dollsto either the boss or the Hand once their HP is at 25% or lower. Generally, players should figure out an order to feed their Dolls so they don't feed too many at one time and wipe the raid with the resultingReducible Complexity. It is recommended that the melee players feed their Dolls first so the healers can come in and top players off before the next group of Dolls are fed to the bosses.
Players should face the boss north. This sets players up for the next set ofProtean Waves, as well as the followingDrainage. The first set of Waves will be visible and telegraphed, but the following sets will not be telegraphed. To begin, everyone can bait the first four Waves together, then the ranged players move out to the edge of the inner circle to baitSluicewhile the melee players move in close to bait the next set of Waves. The ranged players will then move in to the boss's hitbox to be the closest players to the boss to bait the second set of Waves, while melee players will move to max range to maximize uptime on the boss. 
While taking these waves, do not stand in front of the boss as it fires aProtean Wavein front of it that can't be baited. The boss will then useSplashandDrainage, so tanks should be ready to grab tethers while the rest of the party moves away from them to avoid the AoE from the attack. Tanks should be sure to mitigate this attack and healers should be ready to top everyone's HP off. The boss will follow up with anotherCascade, dealing more heavy damage to the raid, so mitigate this as well.Keeping the boss faced to the north, The Liquid Rages will useThrottle, so healers need to be ready toEsunathese away before the debuff finishes its duration. Then, another set ofProtean Wavesto bait. This time coming from all Rages, the Hand, and the boss itself.To handle this mechanic, Players will first stack behind the boss while the main tank stays in front of the boss to bait the first waves. DPS players should then move to the edges of the Rages to baitSluice, while the ranged players should bait theProtean Wavesfrom theLiquid Ragesto fire off the edge of the arena, while the remaining players bait the Waves from the boss and the Hand to fire between the intercardinals. The DPS will then move in to the rear of the boss's hitbox to bait a third set of Waves while the tanks and a healer will bait the RagesProtean Waves.The boss will then useHand of Prayer/Parting. Following this strategy, the tanks will be separate from each other, so this will result in the Hand forming an open palm. The tanks will have to drag the boss and the Hand back together to resolve the mechanic. The Rages will also useEmbolus, so this should help avoid this mechanic as well. AnotherHand of Painhere, so make sure the boss and the Hand are within 4% of HP to one another. Finally, the boss will useSplashagain and prepare to use a finalCascadeas its enrage, which will wipe the party if the boss is not defeated in time.Note:In practice, most parties will skip the final set of Splashes. Everyone should focus on the boss during the last set ofProtean Wavesand kill it before it uses the finalHand of Pain, which serves as the "de facto" enrage.Intermission: Limit CutAfter defeating theLiving Liquid, players will enter theLimit Cutmini-phase. Players will handle the mechanic of the same name from A11S while also avoiding rotating explosions around the edge and center of the arena.Players should group in the middle of the arena. Every player will be marked with dots above their head from 1-8. This indicates what order players are attacked in. Blue dots indicate odd numbered players, while red dots indicate even numbered players.Cruise Chaserwill spawn behind a blue numbered player and fire a conal cleave (Alpha Sword), knocking the player in that direction. It will then dash (Super Blassty Charge) in the direction of the even numbered player that is next in sequence. If the player who gets dashed is facing away from the boss, they will receive a huge knockback. This will repeat with each set of numbers (1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8). These hits also debuff with bothPhysical Vulnerability UpandMagic Vulnerability Up, meaning players can't take more than one hit.While this is happening,Hawk Blasterswill drop large, untelegraphed circular AoEs on the arena. These will drop four sets of two opposite explosions that rotate clockwise around the arena, followed by one in the center. They will then resume rotating around the edge of the arena, followed by a final explosion in the center, for a total of ten explosion sets. Any player hit by these will die.The most common method to handle this is to have two groups, 1/2, 5/6 and 3/4, 7/8 on opposite sides of the arena running around the arena following the explosions. Players who will handle the mechanics first will stand on the inner ring with lights, while the other set of numbers in that group will stand on the outside ring. The odd numbered players will be in the lead facing forward with the even numbered players standing behind them, facing towards the odd numbered player. Once they have handled their set of mechanics, the groups will switch, moving to the outer ring next to the edge of the arena while the next players move to the inner circle and repeat. Players can use their knockback skills if they want to help minimize risk if they miss an attack.Phase 2:Brute Justice&Cruise ChaserThis phase requires players to handle both bosses mechanics at the same time, moving correctly and handing debuffs off to the correct players to ensure no one is accidentally killed.Mechanics:J Kick: Massive raid-wide damage immediately followingLimit Cut.Whirlwind: Moderate raid-wide damage cast byCruise Chaser.Judgment Nisi: Cast byBrute Justice. This inflicts fourFinal Decree Nisidebuffs, (α,β,γ, andδ) on either the tanks and healers or the four DPS. These debuffs will inflict minor damage-over-time and will fall off when the timer expires. Contacting another player will cause them to acquire the same color debuff. Players need to pass these debuffs back and forth and satisfy theVerdictcondition once the boss finishes its cast ofGavel. If two players with differentNisicolors touch, both players will instantly die (Final Sentence).Link-Up: A healer is debuffed withCompressed Water, and a DPS is debuffed withCompressed Lightning. These debuffs last 30 seconds and explode at their resolution.The mechanics of these debuffs are similar to how they worked in the original Alexander fight.Compressed Watershould be split among at least three players when it resolves and explodes in a large AoE (Crashing Wave) that deals split damage. This debuff will then pass to a random player. The originally debuffed player will receive aWater Resistance DownIIdebuff, meaning they cannot be in the next stack, or they will die. Additionally, when the debuff passes, it will drop aLiquid Ragetornado that will knock back any player too close to it and hit them withDrainage, dealing massive damage. The tornado can be frozen to hide behind to avoidPropeller Windand destroyed byFlarethrower. If a tornado is up for too long, it will explode (Severe Contamination) and wipe the raid.Compressed Lightningis a stack mechanic between two players. If more than two players are stacked, the debuff will inflict full damage to everyone in the stack, likely resulting in deaths. The damage is split in an AoE (Crashing Thunder) when the debuff resolves. Like before, the debuff will pass to the other player and the originally debuffed player will not be able to take the debuff again as they will haveLightning Resistance DownII.If a player with one of the debuffs dies or holds bothCompresseddebuffs at the same time, they will explode and wipe the raid (Punishing Thunder/Punishing Wave).Steam Chakramswill also spawn randomly around the arena on opposite sides. The Chakrams will target a random player and fire across the arena at them in an untelegraphed line AoE (Eye of the Chakram), knocking back and killing anyone hit.Optical Sight: Cast byCruise Chaser: An invisible circular AoE (Hawk Blaster) will spawn at each player's location, then resolve shortly after, killing anyone hit. Players need to bait these and wait until just after the cast resolves to move.Photon: Reduces the HP of all players to 1. Any cast of this afterwards will only affect tanks.Spin Crusher: Frontal conal cleave cast byCruise Chaserthat will knock back and kill anyone hit. Has no AoE indicator.Missile Command: Cast byBrute Justice.Earth Missile(telegraphed AoE) is dropped on the two furthest players, dropping a puddle under the targets. The boss will then castHidden Minefieldon the furthest two players as well, which are telegraphed dark green circular AoEs that must be avoided and will leave behind two invisibleHidden Mines. These will need to be disarmed (run over) by a tank with cooldowns, or they will explode (Hidden Mine Shrapnel) and wipe the party. Mines that are being disarmed will explode in a large AoE, so other players should not get too close. The boss will fire an iceEarth Missileon one of the tanks, and castEnumerationon two random DPS.Enumerationwill always require three players to stand in the circle to resolve. If three players aren't in the circle when it resolves, it kills the players that are inside it. Players cannot be inside both circles, or they will die.The secondEarth Missilethat fires will drop an expanding ice puddle. This needs to be used to freeze the tornado to survivePropeller Wind. Anyone who steps in the puddle will be inflicted withFrostbiteand die.Verdict: Cast byBrute Justice. Will inflict all players withFinal Judgment: Penalty IIIand one ofFinal Judgment: Decree Nisi α / β / γ / δ. Each type ofFinal Judgment: Decree Nisiwill be assigned to one random DPS and one random support. This debuff will indicate whichFinal Decree Nisidebuff they have to be inflicted with by the timeGavelfinishes casting or the party will wipe.Limit Cut:Cruise Chaserbecomes invincible and summons aPlasma Shield. The shield can only be damaged from the front. Players need to destroy this before it disappears or the boss will receive aDamage Upbuff and wipe the raid with its next attack.Flarethrower:Brute Justicecasts an untelegraphed wide conal AoE towards the player closest to it. This can destroy the water tornados.Propeller Wind:Cruise Chaserdamages and inflictsConfusedon  players unless they break the Line-of-Sight with a frozen water tornado.Gavel: Cast byBrute Justice. Checks if all players have the correctNisidebuffs. AllNisiandCompressed Water/Lightningdebuffs will be removed if the check succeeds. Otherwise, the party will instantly wipe.Double Rocket Punch:Brute Justiceuses a heavy-hitting tankbuster that needs to be split between both tanks.Super Jump:Brute Justicejumps on the player that is the furthest away, knocking back and inflictingStunon anyone else hit, then face the new furthest player and useApocalyptic Ray, a massive conal AoE. This will kill any player it hits.Final Sentence:Brute Justicehard enrage. The party will wipe if this cast finishes.Eternal Darkness:Cruise Chaserhard enrage. The party will wipe if this cast finishes.Strategy:Immediately afterLimit Cut, the bosses will spawn and useJ Kick. This needs to be heavily mitigated and healed through, as the attack deals heavy damage. Once the bosses spawn, pull them together in the center of the arena and stack up to bait the Chakrams that spawn on the edges of the arena. Spread out to avoid the attack, wait to baitOptical Sight, then back in once the AoEs appear. Players can not be overlapped with other players as the boss will then castJudgment Nisi, and this will cause debuffs to pass incorrectly, wiping the raid. The boss will castLink-Upsoon after this.At this point, the tanks should split the bosses, one pullingCruise Chaserand the other takingBrute Justice. It is recommended the bosses are kept closer to each other in order to manage their HP and damage, since they need to be defeated at roughly the same time. If one is defeated too quickly and the other can't be downed in time, the surviving boss will enrage and wipe the raid.There should be four passes ofNisiduring this phase beforeGavel. Tanks and healers should have designated partners to pass their debuff to untilVerdictis cast and players need specific debuffs. To minimize errors in passing debuffs, non-marked players should move to their partners and pass through their hitbox to take the debuff. This keeps players from accidentally passing the debuff to the wrong player.The boss will castPhotonat this time. Due to the DoT fromNisi, healers need to cast their shields to prevent deaths. Players will pass their debuffs at this point, then the boss will fire aSpin Crusherat the same time as the debuffs fromLink-Upresolve. Players with these debuffs should move to the designated areas to pass their debuffs. A recommended strategy is to pass the Lightning debuff to the tank holdingBrute Justice, while the rest of the players move to stand near the Water-debuffed player without touching.Healers should bait theEarth Missileand mines near the edge of the arena away from the boss, then have the tank targeted by the ice-aspectedEarth Missiledrop it near the water tornado while the other tank handles the mines with cooldowns. The healers should then move to the DPS marked withEnumeration, then either the tanks or the two remaining DPS should move into the circles. Once all this resolves, players should pass theirNisidebuffs with their partner. The next pass of theCompresseddebuffs should happen, generally the first player to receive the Water stack should take the next Lightning stack, as they can't split the Water AoE. The tank holdingCruise Chasershould pull the boss to an edge and face the boss towards the center of the stage for its next attack.Brute Justicewill then castVerdict, assigning debuffs to players.As this is happening,Cruise Chaserwill castLimit Cut, becoming invincible and summoning aPlasma Shield, which can only be hit from the front. Burn the shield down quickly. While doing this,Brute Justicewill castFlarethrower, which the tank holding this boss will need to direct towards the second spawned water tornado to destroy it. The tank should position themselves into the boss's hitbox to be the 'closest' player to the boss. Immediately afterFlarethrower, players should pass their debuffs. The players withoutNisiwill pickup the debuffs that match theirVerdictrequirement. The boss will follow this up withWhirlwind, requiring players to mitigate and heal through. Healers should be sure to top off everyone's HP, as the next passing ofCompresseddebuffs will happen right after this.After passing theCompresseddebuffs, players should move to where the ice block is, while theCruise Chasertank moves the boss to the intercardinal of the block. The boss will castPropeller Wind, and the players need to break the Line of Sight of this attack. Players will also need to swap their debuffs to the correct players one final time beforeGavel. A common way to handle this mechanic is to line up behind the ice block based on their color. Generally, people line up in order ofBlue, Purple, Orange, Green. FollowingGavel, all debuffs will disappear.The boss will follow up with anotherPhotonthat hits only the tanks and needs to be mitigated and healed through, as following that,Brute Justicewill useDouble Rocket Punch, which both tanks will need to mitigate. After this, the boss will useSuper Jump, leaping to the farthest player from it. This player should be a ranged DPS who should begin moving asDouble Rocket Punchcomes out. After leaping, the boss will castApocalyptic Ray, which needs to be dodged, as it will kill whatever it touches.Cruise Chaserwill castWhirlwindtwice, dealing heavy raid-wide damage, so mitigation is key. At this point the bosses both long-cast their enrages. The bosses both need to be defeated before the cast goes off, and roughly at the same time as each other.Phase 3:Alexander PrimeDuring this phase, the boss will be untargetable for sections of the fight while players handle mechanics made up ofFormationsfrom the bosses from the other phases. The boss will be attacking during these phases, so players will handle these mechanics while also dodgingAlexanders'attacks.Mechanics:Chastening Heat: Heavy-hitting tankbuster that debuffs withMagic Vulnerability Up.Divine Spear: Three magic-damage cleaves on the main tank. This always comes immediately afterChastening Heat, so a tankswap or an invulnerability skill is required.Mega Holy: Massive magic-based raid-wide damage that needs to be heavily mitigated and shielded to survive.Formation One: Temporal Stasis:Players will receive debuffs based on their role:One DPS and one tank or healer are tethered and debuffed withHouse Arrest. These players must be in close proximity to each other when the debuff resolves or they will both die. When the debuff resolves, it will inflict 1 damage or lethal damage if the tether is too long (Plaint of Surety).One DPS and one tank or healer are tethered and debuffed withRestraining Order. These players must be far apart from each other when the debuff resolves or they will die. When the debuff resolves, it will inflict 1 damage or lethal damage if the tether is not long enough (Plaint of Surety).One DPS and one tank or healer are debuffed withAggravated Assault. These players cannot take any additional damage or they will both die. When the debuff resolves, it will inflict moderate damage (Plaint of Severity),Magic Vulnerability UpandPhysical Vulnerability Up, making additional damage lethal until the debuffs expire.One DPS and one tank or healer will not have a debuff.Alpha Sword:Cruise Chaserwill fire a conal AoE at the three closest players to it. These players are debuffed withMagic Vulnerability UpandPhysical Vulnerability Up.Flarethrower: A large conal AoE directed at the two closest players toBrute Justice. Players hit are debuffed with aFire Resistance Down.Based on the debuffs players have, players can stand in set positions and handle mechanics without much movement. Each player will be frozen for several seconds withTemporal Displacementwhen the mechanic resolves. Players can stand near the bosses within their hitbox to bait the attacks, then move out of them so the next group can step in.Formation Two: Inception:Aetheroplasm: Four players will be tethered toPlasmaspheres, large orbs. These orbs will slowly move towards their player, until they reach the tethered player and explode in an AoE, dealing damage (Burst) and dropping a puddle that inflictsHeavyif a player stands in it. If the orbs collide with a different player, they will deal less damage. If two puddles are dropped and overlap, they will explode (Electromagnetic Burst) and wipe the raid.Judgment Crystal: Random players will be marked and will dropJudgment Crystalswhere they are standing. These crystals will explode if they overlap with each other, are nearAlexanderor are touched by theTrue Heartsummoned by an ad. When they explode, they deal proximity damage (Tetrashatter) based on how close players are to them.True Heart:Shanoa, the cat add, will spawn across fromAlexanderand summonsTrue Heart, an ad that will move towardsAlexander. After touching all fourJudgment Crystals, the Heart will turn a golden color and move toAlexander'shitbox and buff players withEnigma Codex, a buff required for the final phase.Inception:Alexanderwill teleport around the arena and fire wide AoESacramentsfrom its cardinals. Players can watch theTrue Heartto see where it moves to know where the boss will spawn and move out of the way of its attacks. Players will also receive various debuffs:A DPS will be debuffed withShared Sentence, which will need to be shared with another player, most likely a tank. The debuff will resolve as a small AoE (Plaint of Solidarity) that will inflict split damage,Magic Vulnerability UpandPhysical Vulnerability Up.One DPS and one tank will be debuffed byRestraining Order.Two DPS will be debuffed withAggravated Assault.Mechanics will appear from the previous bosses from the fight that will also need to be avoided:Flarethrower,Alpha Sword, andSuper Jump.The main tank should grab the boss and face it north, using an invulnerability skill to handleChastening Heat, then the rest of the party should stack in the center and prepare shields for when the boss castsInception.Alexanderwill spawn in either the north or the south of the arena, andBrute Justicewill spawn to the west, then both will start running through mechanics. There is time to adjust to whereAlexanderspawns for these attacks.Players should stand in the center of the arena. ThePlasmasphereswill spawn around the arena and begin tethering to players. The orbs will spawn in random groups, either two in the northwest and southeast, or two in the northeast and southwest. Players that get a tether should move to the north edge of the arena. The untethered players should move to the opposite side of the arena. Players will then be marked for theJudgment Crystals. Once the puddles and crystals are dropped, all the players should move north except the tanks. Healers should make sure everyone is topped off, thenBrute Justicewill useFlarethrower. AfterFlarethrowersresolve, players should use theTrue Heartto build DPS resources for the coming phases.Alexanderwill then cast the various debuffs on players. Watch theTrue Heartto see whereAlexanderwill spawn and move out of the way of theSacramentthat is fired. Based on debuffs, players will need to split up across the arena, with the tanks and the player withShared Sentenceon the west side and the rest of the party to the east. Players with theRestraining Orderdebuff should run to the edges of the arena to guarantee the debuffs requirement is met.Cruise Chaserwill then spawn in the center of the arena and begin castingAlpha Sword, hitting the players closest to it. This attack, as well as the debuffs, will inflict players withMagic Vulnerability Up. Since tanks are in theShared Sentencedebuff as well, they can not be the ones to handleAlpha Sword. Both healers and one of theRestraining OrderDPS will have to bait these. Since they are baiting theAlpha Swords, tanks can handleSuper Jump. Tanks can move away fromBrute Forcewhile the other players move in toCruise Chaserand bait the attack.Formation Three: Wormhole:This phase re-introduces even more mechanics from previous phases that must be handled several at a time, such asLimit Cut, Super JumpandApocalyptic Ray. Accurate player movement and baiting the correct attacks is essential here, and a mistake will most likely cause a wipe.Link-Up: Two Chakrams will spawn at opposite sides of the arena.Missile Command: Two random DPS will be marked forEnumeration.Incinerating Heat: A random player will be marked for a stack mechanic. This attack needs to be shielded and mitigated to handle.Void of Repentance: Two large puddles spawn and need to be soaked by one player each, dealing light damage (Repentance) and  debuffing withVulnerability UpandMagic Vulnerability Up. These puddles must be soaked three times, shrinking in size with each soak, and will explode (Confession) and wipe the raid if not soaked in time.Alexanderwill open this mini-phase with anotherChastening HeatandDivine Spear. This time however, the boss will delay the Spears, requiring a tank swap after the first ability. From here, several abilities will fire in rapid succession. Players should start in the center of the arena to bait Chakrams and set up shields and Regens. Once players are assigned their numbers, they should split to either side of the arena, evens to one side and odds to the opposite. Standing at the intercardinals to the north and south, and at the cardinal south will ensure players don't end up in Void puddles when they spawn. Once the Chakrams fire, players can adjust their position forLimit Cut. Odds should face outwards from the arena, and evens should face their odd partner. Pop knockback skills to guarantee nobody gets knocked out of position. After the first hit ofLimit Cut, players marked with 7 and 8 can move to the east and west, and 5 and 6 can soak the first stack of the Void puddles. This way whenApocalyptic Rayfires, no one will get hit by it. This move cuts across the stage, so players need to be careful to avoid it.Brute Justicewill then useSuper Jumpon either 3 or 4, depending on what player is furthest away. After the jump, the boss will turn around and fireApocalyptic Rayand the puddles will resolve their first soak.Cruise Chaserwill then attack 5 and 6. These players should move slightly up along the edge of the arena to bait theirLimit Cut. 7 and 8 can move to where 5 and 6 previously were, and 1 and 2 can move into the puddles to soak the next hit, finally 5 and 6 should move out of range of the effects of the finalLimit Cut. Once all these resolve, players should group in the center and get ready to mitigate and heal throughIncinerating Heat.After this, the DPS will be marked forEnumeration, they should separate slightly and players should stand in the circles in the correct amounts. Following this,Alexanderwill fireMega Holytwice, dealing more hard-hitting damage. A lot of healing and mitigation is happening here, so tanks and healers need to be ready.Formation Four: Summon Alexander:This formation requires heavy mitigation and healing, as well as a DPS check to beat the enrage.Alexander Primewill summon a massiveAlexanderand  will begin to castDivine Judgment. If this cast finishes, the party will wipe. The bosses will begin using repeating attacks to wipe the party as well.J Storm:Brute Justiceslams the arena, dealing heavy raid-wide damage.J Wave:Brute Justicefires this every few seconds dealing increasingly heavy raid-wide damage and buffing itself with a stack ofDamage Upeach time it is cast.Eternal Darkness:Cruise Chaser'senrage skill. Players need to defeat it before this cast goes off, or the party will wipe. Healers need to focus on mitigation and healing for this phase, as the damage will begin increasing rapidly in both output and amount. Tanks should be using abilities that increase healing output and shields while mitigating boss damage output with moves likeReprisal.The party should defeatCruise Chaseras its enrage will cast first, thenBrute Justiceto stop the increasing damage fromJ Waves. Once both are defeated,Alexander Primewill no longer be invulnerable, so the party should finish it off before the enrage cast finishes.After the bosses are defeated, players will need to group up and use thelevel 3 tank Limit Breakonce the massiveAlexander'scountdown reaches 3 seconds. Players should use their shields and mitigations as well, as the Limit Break alone is not enough to survive the damage for casters. After that, a cutscene ensues in which all three bosses combine and upgrade themselves into the final boss:Perfect AlexanderPhase 4:Perfect AlexanderMechanics:When the phase opens, the boss will castThe Final Word, causing players will receive debuffs from the boss that will move players when they resolve:Three players will receiveFinal Word: Contact Prohibition, which is denoted by a yellow icon with an arrow. Upon the timer expiring, this debuff will becomeContact Prohibition Ordained. Players with this debuff will move towards players withContact Regulation Ordained. If these players end up colliding, they will die (Divine Retribution).One player will receiveFinal Word: Contact Regulation, denoted with an orange starburst icon. Upon the timer expiring, this debuff will becomeContact Regulation Ordained.Three players will receiveFinal Word: Escape Prohibitionand is denoted with a blue and white icon with an arrow. Upon the timer expiring, this debuff will becomeEscape Prohibition Ordained. These players will move away from the player withEscape Detection Ordained. If they touch that player or move too far away from them, they will die (Divine Retribution).One player will receiveFinal Word: Escape Detection, denoted by a purple icon. Upon the timer expiring, this debuff will becomeEscape Detection Ordained.Note that if anyone withContact RegulationorEscape Detectiondies, all of their "followers" (i.e. players withContact ProhibitionorEscape Prohibition, respectively) will also die (Divine Retribution).Ordained Motion: Players must be constantly moving at the time of the cast, or they will die. This is denoted by a white sword marker.Ordained Stillness: Players must be perfectly still at the time of the cast, including not auto-attacking. This is denoted by a black sword.Optical Sight: Players will either all be marked withIndividual Reprobationand need to spread out to avoid AoEs, orCollective Reprobationand two random players will be marked with stack markers and should separate slightly to avoid overlapping. Note that taking the stack solo will cause the marked player to explode (Faithlessness) and wipe the raid.Ordained Capital Punishment: A heavy-hitting triple hit magic-based tankbuster that needs to be split with the off tank.Ordained Punishment: A heavy magic-based tankbuster that debuffs withPhysical Vulnerability Up. Since the boss's auto-attacks are physical, a tankswap is required. This attack always follows Capital Punishment.Almighty Judgment: The boss shows the locations of AoEs briefly, which players need to remember and dodge. These AoEs will fire at the start ofIrresistible Grace'scast bar.Irresistible Grace: A random player is marked for stacking. This should be mitigated, as it deals heavy magic-based damage.Fate Projection: Creates clones of all party members and shows what mechanics they will do whenFate Calibrationfinishes casting. Players will be able to identify their clone by the arrow that points to them. Players will only be able to see their clone if they have theEnigma Codexbuff from Phase 3 and are alive at the start of this mechanic.Fate Calibration α: A series of mechanics will be shown while the cast bar fills.Ordained Motion/Stillnesswill be first, based on the sword that appears over the clone, followed by a mechanic based on role type:A gear will appear around three clones, denotingAggravated Assault.One clone will have stacking gears appear on it, denotingShared Sentence.One clone will have a circle pulsing from it, denotingDefamation. This player will need to move to the opposite side of the arena from the rest of the party.One clone will receive no debuffs.Ordained Motion/Stillnesswill appear for the third mechanic, denoted again by the color of the sword over the clone’s head.The fourth mechanic will spawn threeAlexanderclones and each will fire aSacramentwith one not firing. This clone indicates a safe zone directly in front of it.Fate Calibration β: Similar to the previousFate Calibration, this phase will show what mechanics will be coming after the cast bar fills:The debuffsContact Regulation Ordained /Contact Prohibition Ordainedused inThe Final Wordwill be applied to players. Their clones will receive a bright light over their heads. The clone receivingContact Regulation Ordainedwill not move after the light appears, while those receivingContact Prohibition Ordainedwill move. Players marked withContact Prohibitionwill also receive additional debuffs that will be visually indicated on the clone:One player receivesRestraining Order(blue tether).One player receivesHouse Arrest(red and green tether).One player receivesShared Sentence(stack gear).Players with dark markers over their heads will receiveEscape Detection Ordained /Escape Prohibition Ordained. The clone receivingEscape Detection Ordainedwill not move after the light appears, while those receivingEscape Prohibition Ordainedwill move. The players withEscape Prohibitionwill also receive additional debuffs that will be visually indicated on the clone:One player will be marked withRestraining Order.One player will be marked withHouse Arrest.One player will not receive any additional debuffs.The second mechanic is threeJ Jumps, which are large AoEs from three clones that inflictPhysical Vulnerability Up. These will be baited by the Purple marked player, the Blue debuffed player withRestraining Order, and the Blue debuffed player with no additional debuffs.The third mechanic isOptical Sight: Individual/Collective Reprobation. The north clone will fire either two large orbs (light party stacks, one targeting a dark player and the other targeting a light player) or eight small orbs (full party spread) to indicate which attack is coming out.The fourth mechanic isRadiant Sacrament, a donut AoE. Players will need to move directly in front of the clone to avoid this attack.Strategy:The main tank should grab enmity on the boss again. The boss will auto-attack a few times, then castFinal Word. To handle this mechanic, the player withContact Regulationshould move to the opposite side of the arena away from the group, the players withContact Prohibitionshould stand in a row in front of players withEscape Prohibition, while the player withEscape Detectionshould stand behind them.Ordained Motion/Stillnesswill fire, and players will have to handle accordingly. The debuffs will take effect, and players should be move correctly without any deaths. Immediately after this, the oppositeOrdainedattack will come out.Optical Sightis next, and players should be ready to mitigate this damage and move according to whichever markers come out.Fate Calibration αwill begin casting, and players will need to watch their clones to know what mechanics are coming and how to handle them once the cast resolves and move to safe spots in front of and across from theAlexander Clonethat didn't fire aSacrament. The player marked withDefamationwill stand in the safe zone in front of the clone. In the other safe zone, theAggravated Assaultplayer will stand on one side of the safe zone, theShared Sentenceand non-debuffed player will stack on the other side of the safe zone.The boss will become untargetable, and players can begin following the mechanics presented previously. Be sure not to accidentally clip players with mechanics in your safe zone. Be sure not to move until the clones all fire theirSacrament.Following this sequence, the boss will begin usingOrdained Capital PunishmentandOrdained Punishment. Handle the first attack with an invincibility, then tankswap after all three hits ofOrdained Capital Punishmenthave fired. Use cooldowns to mitigate the second attack.The boss will then begin the cast bar forFate Calibration β. Players will need to watch to see which debuffs they will be assigned. Players should also be on the lookout for the safe zone for theRadiant Sacramentand where to move forOptical Sight. At around 30% the debuffs forFinal Wordwill show on the clones. Players will stand on the west edge or the north edge at the cardinals based on their debuffs and the tethers for the additional debuffs:The player with the purple debuff will stand behind every other player.The player with the orange debuff will stand at the north cardinal of the arena.Players with the yellow debuff will stand in front of the purple debuffed players, closer to the north to move in that direction at the debuffs resolution.The blue debuff players withHouse Arrest; will stack with the yellow players.The blue debuff players withRestraining Orderwill stand in front of the purple debuffed player, closer to the south to get moved to the north.The blue debuff player with no extra debuffs will stand directly in front of the purple player to end up moving straight to the east. Players will move into the safe zones and stay there untilShared SentenceandSuper Jumpboth resolve.Players will then handleOptical Sightstacking or spreading accordingly. After this, players will move to the safe zone forRadiant Sacrament. The boss will follow up with another series of tankbusters, then move intoAlmighty JudgmentandIrresistible Grace.Pull the boss to the center of the arena. The boss castAlmighty Judgmentand will show three sets of AoEs here that players need to memorize. Players will need to dodge each set of AoEs correctly, as getting hit by one will almost certainly cause a wipe. Following these AoEs, the boss will castIrresistible Grace. The party will have to stack and heavily mitigate the attack. 
After this, the tank can turn the boss to the north and the party should move behind the boss. The boss will use anotherCapital Punishmentset which need to be mitigated and tankswapped. Healers should fill the tanks health after this. Another set ofAlmighty JudgmentandIrresistible Graceto be handled the exact same way as before, then the boss will move to the center of the arena and begin to cast its enrage,Temporal Prison.A space will light up and cages will begin dropping onto the platform to the northeast of the boss and continue doing so at the cardinals and intercardinals moving clockwise. Players should move to these positions with the healers taking the first two cages, the tanks taking the next two, and finally the DPS. Anyone with damage-over-time (DoT) abilities should refresh their DoTs on the boss before they are caged, as they will be incapacitated withTemporal Displacementand unable to attack. A few seconds after all players are caged, the fight will reset to the beginning, so the party must defeat the boss before this happens. Missing a cage will cause the fight to instantly reset.Reward1Colossus TotemEpic of Alexander Adventurer PlateWhen originally released, you could receive only one reward item per week for completing duties in The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate).
