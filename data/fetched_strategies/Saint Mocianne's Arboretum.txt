Alas, in the wake of the Exodus it has since been abandoned, the teeming life within now roaming the halls with reckless abandon. A band of treasure hunters would pierce the heart of this leafy labyrinth in search of treasure, a treasure they claim would be a boon to Idyllshire.

These have their own small breath attacks, though fortunately they do not spin. The boss will randomly spin clockwise or counterclockwise, so pay attention to which way he's turning. Starting on the second spinning breath attack, he'll summon Rose Hips, which look like balloons. They need to be killed quickly before they explode and do raid wide damage.Avoid breath attacksPrioritize killing Rose Hip addsQueen HawkThere are several bees that randomly fly around the edge of the room. They will target random players and use a column AoE attack that needs to be dodged. When the Queen uses 'Ally', they will gather in two groups along the edge and launch a huge double column AoE attack with no ground marker. The bees blend in with the walls so you will need to pay attention to get out of the way in time.
Partway through the fight, several Knight Hawk bee adds will appear and tether to the boss. This is a DPS check where the boss will do raid wide damage that gets stronger every time, so burn them down quickly.Do not stand in front of beesKill Knight Hawk addsUsesBlue MagespellAvailBelladonnaThe first noteworthy attack is a big AoE which you only can dodge by being next to the boss, you have time to run towards him so it shouldn't be an issue. After that he'll summon Bulbs that will place ground AoEs that give you a stackable magic vulnerability up debuff. At the same time he'll start casting Frond Fatale, which charm you into running inside the Bulbs' AoE to get the debuff. To avoid being charmed you need to look away from the boss, be aware that the cast time is rather short. Besides this there is one more room wide AoE that hits for about 4K. He also summons some targetable adds which need to be killed.Don't stand in yellow circlesLook away when the boss casts Frond FataleLootSee also:Ilvl 185 Dungeon ArmorandIlvl 185 Dungeon

Arboretum10Discover every location withinSaint Mocianne's Arboretum.-3.1ImagesGear ImagesDungeon ImagesLoreThe Forgotten GardensThe scholars of Sharlayan established this arboretum near their settlement in the Dravanian hinterlands. Building conservatories to simulate diverse climes from the tropical through to the arid, they cultivated plants and seedkin gathered from all the lands of the world. During its heyday, the arboretum bustled with botanists who tended the plant life, its research center documenting discoveries in areas such as trait improvement, agricultural techniques, and plant-based remedies. Sadly, the exodus saw it abandoned, and the teeming life within was left to run wild and unchecked.BelladonnaFormerly a research subject, this carnivorous seedkin managed to survive and thrive in the wake of the arboretum’s abandonment. The species is known to lure potential victims by contorting its petals into the form of various beasts; that this particular specimen mimicked a woman suggests that it identified its Sharlayan caretakers as prey—a harrowing thought and
an ominous warning.Queen HawkThe tarantula hawk is a species of aggressive bee native to the New World. The queen commands the colony by secreting her pheromones, which grant her total control over her minions. Moving as one, they swarm and overwhelm any threats to their monarch with nary a care for losses.MoreThe arboretum was home not only to plants and seedkin; symbiotic wildlife such as pollinating bees were also kept, and they too were left to their own devices following, the exodus. In time their numbers burgeoned, and a colossal hive came to occupy part of the gardens, giving rise to a bizarre waxen landscape.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
