The raid is also known asE6S.Contents1Phases & Abilities1.1Heritors of Fury: Garuda & Ifrit1.2Phase 1: Garuda1.3Phase 2: Ifrit1.4Phase 3: Garuda & Ifrit1.5Phase 4: Raktapaksa2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 23ImagesPhases & AbilitiesHeritors of Fury:Garuda&IfritNOTE:Players who touch the edge of the circular arena will instantly die.Phase 1:GarudaNOTE:The majority of successful strategies involve keeping Garuda as close to the arena centre as possible during the encounter.Superstorm- deals unavoidable raid-wide damage that will require shielding and/or healing.Occluded Front- spawns multiple wind-orbs around the edge of the arena that will eventually fire straight-line AoE's across the battlefield. At the same time, Garuda will tether herself to all four damage-dealers and prepare to blast massive cone-AoE's in their direction, forcing all four tethered players to spread out in inter-cardinal directions (NE, NW, SE, SW) of Garuda, just outside of the point-blank AoE that will spawn beneath her.NOTE:The straight-line shots from wind-orbs can break tethers and chains connected to players (by having them shoot through said tether/chain), yet most Furor (Savage) strategies will render this unnecessary.Storm of Fury- cast at the same time asOccluded Front- will create a large point-blank AoE underneath Garuda that the raid must avoid. Tethered players should aim to squeeze themselves beside the point-blank AoE circle and the line-AoE fromOccluded Frontwind orbs. If done correctly, the entire arena will be blasted by cone-AoE's, yet only two people will be damaged per AoE, and no tethers will be broken.Aerial Stack- creates bluish-white circles around each damage dealer that will eventually launch marked players into the air and fatally impale them unless an unmarked player stacks with a marked player (within their circle) to share the damage. Due to being four circles, a tank and healer should each be assigned to a damage-dealer and be ready to help soak that damage-dealer's circle. Just like earlier, it is best to stand at cardinal or inter-cardinal directions around Garuda, giving everyone space to soak circles (without overlapping other circles), yet also being close enough so that melee damage-dealers can maintain uptime on Garuda during the process. If shared successfully, marked players will not be launched and, instead, circle-AoE's will be left wherever the marked players were previously standing, which the raid must avoid. If unsuccessful, the lone (marked) player will be launched into the air and unable to move out of the impending AoE circle, which will fire up spikes of wind to fatally impale them.Ferostorm- similar to normal mode - spawns two blades of wind at random points around Garuda. After a brief delay, vicious conal-AoE's of massive size will be fired in the direction of the blades, carving anyone in their path. To avoid, simply spread out and ensure that these blades are not facing your current location.Central Knockback+Aerial Stack- spawns a large circle in the arena centre that will eventually knockback all members of the raid, just like normal mode. Simultaneously, each tank and healer will acquire the blue-white circle, indicating anotherAerial Stack. As you can imagine, the goal here is to ensure that each marked player (and at least one unmarked player) are knocked back together to remain stacked. Bear in mind that the flaming edge of the arena is adeath wall, meaning that anyone knocked back too far will be instantly slain, so make sure that every marked player (and at least one unmarked player) stand together as close to theCentral Knockbackcircle as possible (or both utilizeknockback immunityto remain in the same location). Don't forget thatAerial Stack(blue-white circles) will always leave behind regular AoE circles afterwards on the ground that everyone must avoid.Vacuum Slice- cast after Garuda flies to the arena centre - will essentially slice the arena in half via a large straight-line AoE, creating anotherdeath wallthat will instantly slay anyone who touches it. Due to upcoming mechanics, the raid should evenly split in half (i.e. a tank, a healer and two DPS, preferably those who were assigned to each other for previous mechanics) with one half of the raid on each side of the 'divide'.Occluded Front- spawns more wind orbs on both sides of the 'divide' near the outer edge of the arena in one of two possible patterns (one pattern per side), whilst simultaneously tethering herself to each damage dealer, just like earlier. She will also spawn a point-blank AoE under herself once again, forcing the raid to split into pairs and move to safe spots between the wind-orbs. Before detonating, Garuda will also cast a knockback on each side of the 'divide' that will push all players (and all wind-orbs) towards theVacuum Slicedeath-wall. The goal is for each tethered player to stack with their assigned partner at inter-cardinal safe-spots between the wind-orbs and be knocked back together (without being pushed into theVacuum Slice. Failure to do so will result in the large conal AoE's fired at tethered players to overlap and cause tremendous damage. Once pushed back, players must then move away from the wind-orbs to avoid their AoE explosions.NOTE:There are two possible patterns for wind-orbs and there will be one pattern for each side of the divide. Thefirstpattern is three orbs forming a straight line, providing two safe-spots. If your side of the divide gains this straight-line pattern of orbs, have a tethered player (and an assigned partner) stand between the left+centre orb and another pair stand between the right+centre orb. Thesecondpattern consists of four orbs forming a semi-circle inside the outer-edge of the arena, also providing two safe-spots. If this is your pattern, have a tethered player (and an assigned partner) stand between the two left-most orbs and the other pair stand between the right-most orbs. Once Garuda charges her knockback, all orbs (and players) will be pushed towards the vacuum slice and simultaneously blast massive conal AoE's in the direction of tethered players. If done correctly, each pair will be blasted by their respective conal-AoE (with no overlap) and be given ample space after the knockback to avoid the AoE explosions from orbs.After these overlapped mechanics have concluded, the 'divide' fromVacuum Slicewill disperse.Ferostorm- spawns two blades of wind at random points around Garuda just like earlier. Once again, simply spread out and ensure that these blades are not facing your current location.Having reached this point, Garuda will exit the arena, leaving behind a proximity marker which all players must move away from. After a delay, Ifrit will land in this location, dealing damage to the entire raid depending on how close they were to the proximity marker, resulting in the end of phase 1.Phase 2:IfritHands of Flame- tethers Ifrit to its main target, eventually leading to a vicious double-punch that will inflict thelight-headeddebuff on the victim and also cause them to drop anEruption(large AoE circle) beneath their present location that should be avoided. If a target withlight-headedreceives any further damage from specific mechanics during the debuff (such as anotherHands of Flame,Instant Incineration, orHands of Hell), they will becomeconcussed- launched into the air and stunned (which can be fatal) - meaning that a tank-swap should be utilized duringHands of Flameso that the debuffed tank can recover from the debuff and avoid this risk.Eruption- the large AoE circle left behind by theHands of Flameuppercut (and various other mechanics during the battle) should be avoided by all players.Instant Incineration- a vicious tank-buster against Ifrit's primary target that is indicated by a large red marker (similar to normal mode). After a brief delay, the marked target will receive a vicious uppercut, inflictinglight-headed.Instant Incinerationhits considerably harder thanHands of Flameand will require high healing and/or shielding. Remember, ifInstant Incinerationis cast on a target effected bylight-headed, that target will be launched and stunned. If you have utilized a tank-swap during the previousHands of Flame, this will be avoided.Meteor Strike- causes Ifrit to target the location of its primary target and blast it with a devastating AoE tankbuster after a brief delay. All participants (including the targeted tank) must ensure they move far enough away from the targets previous location (whileMeteor Strikeis being cast) to avoid taking damage.Inferno Howl- inflicts unavoidable raid-wide damage that will require moderate AoE healing and/or shielding.Hands of Hell (1)- places a bundle of four shareable tethers onto a random healer. Much like normal mode, players must make an effort to collect (or pass on) tethers so that the original target only has one left. After a delay, Ifrit will uppercut tethered players, applylight-headedto each victim, and cause each target to drop anEruption(AoE circle) beneath their current location.Seeing as anyone damaged by a tether will receivelight-headed, this means that holding more than one tether will not only inflict tremendous damage but also result in an unavoidableconcussion(the previously mentioned knock-up and stun). This also means that anyone who already has alight-headeddebuff from previous mechanics should avoid taking a tether. In either case, the victim will end upconcussed(stunned) and unable to avoid the upcomingEruptionbeneath their feet, which is typically fatal.Due toEruptionbeing dropped underneath each tethered player, be sure to spread out if taking tethers. To avoid the possibility oflight-headedoverlaps, it is wise to assign players to each round of tethers, starting with both healers and two damage dealers so that the tanks can shake off previous applications oflight-headedfrom the previousHands of FlameandInstant Incineration.Strike Spark- creates multipleorbs of flamethroughout the arena that will eventually unleash a broad AoE explosion at their location. Due to the placement of the orbs, there will currently be no safe-spot within the arena. However, after a brief delay, four clones of Ifrit will appear, each one standing behind a random orb. Eventually, all clones will simultaneously kick their chosen orb in the direction they are facing viaHot Foot, leaving one possible safe-spot. It will be up to the raid to determine where this safe-spot will be located. Unfortunately, all players will also drop anEruptionbeneath their feet beforehand, preventing everyone from immediately moving to this safe-spot as these eruption AoE's will make it unsafe.To combat the overlapped mechanics, all participants should stack somewhere in the centre while identifying where Ifrit will create a safe-spot with the orb-kicks. Once the safe location has been identified and allEruptionAoE's are dropped, the raid should move out of the AoE eruptions into the single safe-spot before theorbs of flameexplode.Hands of Hell (2)- places a bundle of four shareable tethers onto a random damage dealer. Just like earlier, players must make an effort to pass (or collect) tethers so that the original target only has one left. After a delay, Ifrit will uppercut tethered players, applylight-headedto each victim, and cause each target to drop anEruption(AoE circle) beneath their current location. In this situation, it is wise to have all other damage dealers collect a tether from the target, leaving both tanks and healers free for future mechanics. Don't forget to spread out and avoid the upcomingEruptionbeneath each tethered target.Hands of Flame- tethers Ifrit to its main target, just like earlier, leading to thelight-headedinflicting double-punch and a followupEruption(large AoE circle) beneath their present location. Once again, the tank and off-tank should coordinate a swap whileHands of Flameis being cast to avoid the possibility of stackinglight-headedduring future mechanics, such as:Instant Incineration+Meteor Strike- Ifrit will utilize the vicious tank-buster once more against the current tank (as indicated by the large red marker). Just like earlier, the marked target will receive a devastating uppercut for massive damage and receive thelight-headeddebuff. As soon asInstant Incinerationhas concluded, Ifrit will immediately unleash anotherMeteor Strike, causing Ifrit to target the location of its primary target and blast that area with a devastating AoE tankbuster. Remember - once Ifrit begins to castMeteor Strike, all participants (including the target) must move away from that targets previous location as soon as possible.On reaching this point, Ifrit will soon be joined by Garuda, leading to phase 3.Phase 3: Garuda & IfritAs soon as Garuda and Ifrit join forces, they will both cast an ability, marking all players (based on their proximity to Garuda or Ifrit) with eitherHated of the VortexorHated of the Embers. Anyone withHated of the Vortexwillonlybe able to target Garuda, whereas anyone withHated of Emberswillonlybe able to target Ifrit. While the debuffs will be evenly spread (i.e.. one per tank, healer and two damage dealers), the fact that it can be baited via proximity means that the raid can split the group and assign those roles to a boss. To do so, split the raid evenly and have one group stand near Garuda and one near Ifrit. This ensures that there is no confusion, allowing the raid to prepare for upcoming mechanics more easily.With Garuda and Ifrit joining forces, both groups will now have to contend with a range of combined mechanics, starting with:Occluded Front- spawns multiple wind-orbs around the edge of the arena that will eventually fire straight-line AoE's across the battlefield that should be avoided. Simultaneously, Ifrit will castHands of Flame(the double-punch against its primary target that inflictslight-headed, as well asEruptionbeneath their feet afterward), followed byInstant Incineration, the vicious red-marker uppercut, and lastly,Meteor Strike. Seeing as the raid has been evenly split byHated of the Vortex/Embers, it can be wise to ensure that a tank capable ofinvulnerabilityfocuses on Ifrit and uses this cooldown to take both hits fromHands of FlameandInstant Incineration. Don't forget to move away from the target's location while Ifrit is castingMeteor Strike!Vacuum Slice- Garuda flies to the arena centre and slices the arena in half via a large straight-line AoE, creating adeath wallthat will instantly slay anyone who touches it. Unlike phase one, the entire raid can stack on one side of the divide.Occluded Front+Hot Foot- spawns multiple windy orbs around the arena. Just like before, a knockback on each side of the divide will eventually push all players (and the orbs) towards the vacuum slice. However, Ifrit will also select an orb and prepare to kick it out of position. Furthermore,Eruptionwill soon place AoE's beneath every member of the raid, preventing them from running immediately to the safe-spot thatHot Foot(kick) will provide. Instead, the group should stack together, wait forEruptionto drop AoE's beneath the raid, then move towards the safe spot. Don't forget, the knockback still risks pushing players into theVacuum Slice, so make sure to stack away from the void-wall when baitingEruption. After the knockback, simply avoid standing close to any of the wind-orbs, as they will eventually explode.Ferostorm- spawns two blades of wind at random points around Garuda. Just like before, vicious conal-AoE's of massive size will be fired in the direction of the blades, carving anyone in their path. Simply spread out and ensure that these blades are not facing your current location.Having survived their united assault, the raid will witness a transitional animation, much like normal mode. Whilst Garuda and Ifrit merge together, the raid will suffer unavoidable AoE damage, so be ready to heal, shield and mitigate. From here, the final phase begins.Phase 4: RaktapaksaOnce Garuda and Ifrit have merged into Raktapaksa, it is recommended that it be tanked in the arena centre for the rest of the battle whenever possible.Hands of Hell (3)- places a bundle of four shareable tethers onto a random healer. Once more, players must make an effort to collect (or pass on) tethers so that the original target only has one left. After a delay, Raktapaksa will applylight-headedto each tethered player, cause them to drop anEruptionbeneath their feet (which must be avoided), and also launch massive straight-line AoE's in their direction. To combat this, it is best to have all tanks and healers collect a tether (so that damage dealers are free to maintain uptime) and have tethered players spread out in a distant semi-circle on one side of the boss (giving plenty of space for the raid to avoid tetheredEruptionAoE's. OnceHands of Hellhas concluded, the entire arena (except one safe-spot directly beneath Raktapaksa) will be marked by line AoE's which the entire raid should avoid. Never stack too close to the boss, as doing so will dropEruptionAoE's on the one single safe-spot.Hands of Hell (4)- places a bundle of four shareable tethers onto a random damage dealer which should be handled just like before, except this time, all damage dealers should take a tether so that tanks and healers do not receive anotherlight-headeddebuff. Once concluded, the arena will be sliced by straight-line AoE's, leaving only one safe spot directly beneath the boss. Again, make sure to spread out into a distant semi-circle so that the followingEruptionAoE's do not overlap the single safe-spot.Inferno Howl- inflicts unavoidable raid-wide damage that will require moderate AoE healing and/or shielding.Aerial Stack+Ferostorm- the stack mechanic from phase 1 (indicated by bluish-white circles around each tank and healer) will eventually launch marked players into the air and fatally impale them unless an unmarked player stacks with a marked player (within their circle) to share the damage. If you have assigned pairs for handling this in the first phase, simply stack with your partner at cardinal or inter-cardinal positions around the boss. Don't forget that players marked forAerial Stackwill drop an AoE circle at their feet which must be avoided. During this ordeal,Ferostorm(two blades of wind that shoot massive conal AoE's in the direction they are facing) will be unleashed shortly afterAerial Stackhas concluded, so make sure to move out of their path.Strike Spark- creates multipleorbs of flamethroughout the arena that will eventually unleash a broad AoE explosion at their location, just like in phase 2. After a brief delay, four clones of Raktapaksa will prepare to kick four orbs into different positions. Once more, it is up to the raid to determine where the single safe-spot will be formed, bait theEruptionAoE's by stacking somewhere in the centre, then move towards this safe-spot to avoid the impending orb explosions.'Hands of Flame- will be cast whilst players are dealing withStrike Spark. Raktapaksa tethers to the main tank whilst the raid is moving towards a safe-spot, unleashing a dash-punch towards the victim (inflictinglight-headed) and dropping massive AoE's to its left and right, leaving behind a small 'safe-lane' through the arena centre. Due to theEruptionbeneath the target ofHands of Flame, the entire raid will immediately need to move down the safe-lane, and due to the application oflight-headed, tanks must decide between tank-swapping so that the followup attack doesn't causeconcussion, or have the main-tank utilize aninvulnerabilitycooldown to tank the combination without having to move.Central Knockback- spawns a large circle at Raktapaksa's location that will eventually knockback all members of the raid. Players must move close to the circle (or utilizeknockback immunity') to avoid being knocked into the death-wall surrounding the arena.Conflag Strike- after a delay, the entire arena (except for two safe-spots to the east and west) will be drowned in flaming puddles. Simultaneously, each tank and healer will be chained together, and all damage dealers will be chained together as well. Should anyone stray too far from their chained partner, the chain will explode, typically leading to fatal damage. As a result, the entire raid must stack together and move towards one of the two safe-spots together without moving too far from their chained partner.Blaze Tornadoeswill now form in the north and south of the arena. After a delay, each tornado will begin to fire massive cone AoE's in the direction of the player closest to it. Simultaneously, wind-orbs (similar toOccluded Front) will spawn at one side of each tornado and prepare to shoot straight-line AoE's across the arena at players furthest away. Don't forget - the straight-line AoE's from wind-orbs canbreak tethers & chains, yet should they succeed in breaking any chains, the resulting explosion will be devastating.As a result, both tanks (and their chained healers) should each choose aBlaze Tornadoand stand directly beside it (on the opposite side of the windy-orb), while the healer chained to them stands in front of it (close enough so that their chains will not break via distance). This will force the tornado's to shoot their cone AoE's out of the arena (rather than across it), saving the raid from taking fatal damage. Once both tornado's have fired off five cone AoE's, they will dissipate.Regarding the two wind-orbs (which will target players farthest away and fire three blasts each), all chained damage-dealers should remain near the arena centre (one one side of the boss) and make sure to move out of any straight-line AoE's from the windy-orbs once they have been baited to shoot in their direction. After being baited, they will fire twice more, so simply move (in unison) from one side of the boss to the other repeatedly until all three shots have been fired.Aerial Stack- marks various players with bluish-white circles (just like earlier) and will fatally launch them into the air unless an unmarked player stacks within the circle. Seeing as thechainsstill persist at this point, each player marked with the bluish-white circles should stack with their chained partner. However, Raktapaksa will also cast a massive donut AoE, leaving only a small safe circle in the centre of the arena to work with. As a result, marked players should spread out in cardinal or inter-cardinal points around the boss at the very edge of the safe-circle to ensure that there is enough space to avoid overlap.A good rule of thumb, seeing asAerial Stackis cast immediately afterBlaze Tornadoes(which forced each tank and their chained healer to move north/south to handle a tornado each), is to have the chained Tanks/Healers move together from the north/south into safe circle, whilst all damage dealers (who were already close to the boss to avoid wind-orbs) simply move to the east or west side of the boss with their chained partner.Conflag Strikeconcludes with Raktapaksa unleashing a massive conal AoE in the direction it is facing (without any telegraph) that will fatally wound anyone caught in its wake. Should you survive theAerial Stack, have the raid stack behind the boss to avoid being chopped.Aerial Stack+Occluded Front+Storm of Fury- spawns multiple wind-orbs around the edge of the arena that will eventually fire straight-line AoE's across the battlefield which can break tethers and chains. At the same time, four players will also be marked by the bluish-whiteAerial Stackcircles. Just like in phase 1, Raktapaksa will tether itself to four players and prepare to blast massive conal AoE's in their direction, forcing all four tethered players to spread out in inter-cardinal directions (NE, NW, SE, SW) along with their assigned chain/aerial partner.Storm of Fury- cast at the same time asOccluded Front- will create a large point-blank AoE underneath Raktapaksa that the raid must avoid. Tethered players should aim to squeeze themselves beside the point-blank AoE circle and the line-AoE fromOccluded Frontwind orbs. If done correctly, the entire arena will be blasted by conal AoE's, yet only each tethered player (and their chain/aerial-stack partner) will be damaged by a single conal AoE, with no tethers/chains broken.Inferno Howl- inflicts unavoidable raid-wide damage that will require moderate AoE healing and/or shielding.Hands of Hell (5)+Occluded Front- places four shareable tethers onto a random healer that should be shared with the other healer and both tanks. Simultaneously, four wind-orbs will form at intercardinal points around the arena edge that will eventually shoot tether/chain-breaking straight-line AoE's across the platform. Just like all other versions, players must make an effort to collect (or pass on) tethers so that the original target only has one left. Once tethers have been collected, each tethered player should move to an intercardinal point around the boss (without moving too far, as the wind-orbs will risk breaking the tethers). Once the wind-orbs have fired, tethered players can move further.After a delay, Raktapaksa will applylight-headedto each tethered player, cause them to drop anEruptionbeneath their feet (which must be avoided), and also launch massive straight-line AoE's in their direction. OnceHands of Hellhas concluded, the entire arena (except one safe-spot directly beneath Raktapaksa) will be marked by line AoE's which the entire raid should avoid, leaving only one safe spot directly beneath the boss.Hands of Hell (6)+Aerial Stack- places four shareable tethers onto a random damage dealer that should be shared with other damage dealers (to avoidconcussingtanks and healers that dealt with the previousHands of Hell). Simultaneously, all tanks and healers will be marked by bluish-white circles, representingAerial Stack. OnceHands of Hellconcludes, Raktapaksa will launch himself towards all tethered damage-dealers, inflictinglight-headed, carving a straight-line AoE in their direction, and forcing each target to drop anEruption.Aerial Stackwill conclude at the exact same time, which will also drop another AoE circle on the floor. Simply move out of both floor-based AoE's, then move into the safe-spot left directly beneath Raktapaksa.As soon as both mechanics have concluded, Raktapaksa's main target will receive aHands of Flame+Instant Incineration+Meteor Strikecombo, much like they did earlier in the final phase. Don't forget to tank-swap (if the targeted tank has no invulnerability cooldown to tank the double-tank buster). Don't forget to move away from the tank's location duringMeteor Strike.Ferostorm- spawns two blades of wind at random points around Raktapaksa. Just like before, vicious conal-AoE's of massive size will be fired in the direction of the blades, carving anyone in their path. Simply spread out and ensure that these blades are not facing your current location. Bear in mind thatFerostormwill be casttwice in a row.Central Knockback- spawns a large circle at Raktapaksa's location that will eventually knockback all members of the raid. Players must move close to the circle (or utilizeknockback immunity') to avoid being knocked into the death-wall surrounding the arena.If you have reached this point, Raktapaksa will move to one end of the arena and begin to charge an enragedConflag Strike- the fatal front-cone AoE slice. Due to there being no safe-spot, the raid have a limited window to slay Raktapaksa beforehand. If unsuccessful, the entire raid will be instantly slain.
