every location withinAla Mhigo.-4.0ImagesLoreLiberty Or DeathHaving conquered all the lands of Gyr Abania, King Anshelm ordered the construction of a fortress city that would serve to repel invaders from Ilsabard. Completed in the year 1135 of the Sixth Astral Era, it stood as a symbol of defiance until it fell to the Empire, whereupon it became a symbol of oppression.In the twenty years that it lay under Garlean rule, little of Ala Mhigo appears to have changed, but upon closer inspection there are imperial touches in evidence, from magitek street lamps to advanced water and sewage systems. However, such improvements to civic life were privileges enjoyed only by imperial citizens. Those without citizenship, or the "Aan," were consigned to hard, destitute lives in the Ala Mhigan Quarter, the purpose-built district for the lower class.Like the rest of the city, the royal palace was allowed to retain its pre-imperial style. Yet beneath the skin, it had been fortified with a multitude of cannons and powerful magitek fields, which greeted the sieging forces of the Eorzean Alliance and the Ala Mhigan Resistance.Zenos yae GalvusLegatus of the XIIth Imperial Legion and crown prince of Garlemald, Zenos’s high birth and extraordinary talents rendered his life wanting for purpose. During a mission in Gyr Abania, however, he encountered a foe who would kindle in him a theretofore unfelt ardor: the Warrior of Light. Against this foe, Zenos would bring his all to bear, wielding the katana Ame-no-Habakiri, his powers as a Resonant—and even the might of the primal Shinryu.Aulus mal AsinaChief of research of the XIIth Imperial Legion, Aulus personally joined the fray during the heroes' assault on the palace. Confronting them, he employed a weapon of his own creation which ripped their aether from their bodies. In this way, he had intended to demonstrate his superiority, but his plan went awry and he died in vain.MoreUpon the rooftop of the royal palace, King Theodoric had built for his foreign queen a garden where familiar creatures from her homeland were kept. Under imperial rule, it was maintained for the pleasure of high-ranking officers.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
