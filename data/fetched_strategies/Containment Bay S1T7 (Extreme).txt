ImportantThe North American and European data centers primarily useParty Finderto challenge (Extreme) content. Using Duty Finder to match with random players is not recommended and will be more difficult than pre-forming a party. For an easy completion (that will satisfy any quest requirements) or loot farming, it is recommended that players use Party Finder and form anUnrestricted Party(i.e., with level sync disabled). Players who wish to complete this duty with level sync enabled should also form a pre-made party, which also enables the use ofMinimum Item LevelandSilence Echosettings for a more authentic challenge compared to a Duty Finder party.This article is about the level 60 challenge-modetrial.

Standing in these circles will gradually deal damage and inflictVulnerability Upstacks. Go to the half of the arena where there are no circles and prepare forFiendish Rage.Fiendish Rage- A healer and a DPS will be marked with stack markers. Sephirot will leap to them one at a time, dealing damage and inflicting aPhysical Vulnerability Updebuff. While running to the safe half of the arena to deal withEin Sof, the healers and off-tank should move to one side while the DPS move to the other. Because of the debuff, the main tank should stand between each group and avoid getting hit.Chesed- Hard-hitting tankbuster with no cast bar, only indicated by Sephirot slowly raising his arm. Tank should re-center the boss and face him away, as this attack is followed by a frontal cleaveTriple Trial.Ain- Sephirot will useEin Sofagain to spawn one green circle, shortly followed by him facing a random party member and cleaving the arena moments later. The group should stand between Sephirot and the circle so that he directsAintowards it, allowing the party to easily deal withRatzon.Ratzon- One party member is targeted with a large purple circle AoE while six are targeted with smaller green circles. The party must run behind Sephirot and spread out. The purple circle can be placed either just behind Sephirot or at the edge of the arena.Ain+Markers/Circles ExamplePhase 2: AddsCochma- Large add that deals strong physical damage and appliesMagic Vulnerability Upstacks over time. The main tank should grab this and be healed regularly. Upon dying, the Cochma deals significant party-wide damage withGenesis. Two of these will appear during the phase.Binah- Smaller adds which the off tank should grab, as they deal magical damage. Upon dying, they each deal moderate party-wide damage withGenesis. Four sets of three Binah adds will appear during the phase.Phase 3Yesod- The ground will flash yellow, and a small circle AoE will be placed under each party member after a small delay, dealing damage and inflicting aDamage Downdebuff. Avoid this by moving away as the flash occurs. If the party isn't grouped up, be sure to avoid moving into someone else's AoE. This attack is used in conjunction with other attacks during this phase.Force Field- Four party members receive a greenForce Against Magicdebuff, which provides a severe physical weakness and a strong magical resistance. The other four receive an orangeForce Against Mightdebuff, which does the inverse. These are used to resolve the following three attacks.Spirit/Life Force- Sephirot will damage half the arena with a green sphere and half with an orange sphere. Be sure to stand in the sphere thatmatches the color of your debuffto avoid fatal damage. When no debuffs are present, this will deal moderate damage to the party.Fiendish Wail- Two towers will appear, one on each side of the arena. At least one party member with anorange debuff must stand in each towerto prevent lethal damage and aVulnerability Upstack from being inflicted on the party. At least one of the four party members should be on each side in preparation to prevent all four from standing in one tower. Four sets of towers will appear throughout the phase, with the latter two requiring a tank to take each as there will not be any debuffs present.Da'at- When debuffs are present, Sephirot will useEin Softo summon expanding circles and tether the four orange-debuff party members. These party members should move away while thegreen-debuff party members move towards Sephirot and grab a tether, preventing fatal damage from being dealt. When no debuffs are present, this deals heavy AoE damage to random party members, starting with a tankbuster on the main tank.Earth Shaker- A healer and a DPS will get a marker above their heads as well as a proximity tether. One should move far to the left and away from Sephirot while the other moves right. AnotherYesodwill occur simultaneously, forcing everyone to move.Pillar of Mercy- The party should stack inside the first blue circle at the northern edge of the arena untilYesodgoes off, then move outside of the circle to be knocked away, without falling off the arena. Two expandingEin Sofcircles will also spawn in sequence, forcing the party to be knocked in a certain direction.Malkuth- Sephirot will lower his head and inflict a strong knockback. Group up near him or use knockback resistance.Pillar of Severity: Prior to this move, four Binahs and a Storm of Words add will spawn. Each tank should grab a pair of Binahs while the party quickly burns down the Storm of Words. Mechanics will continue during this time, so tanks should be prepared to take towers. Eventually, the party will stack on the remains of the Storm of Words to avoid getting knocked off stage by Sephirot.The enrage will be indicated by an unavoidablePillar of Severity.Pillar+Yesod+Ein Sof ExampleEarth Shaker+Yesod PositioningLootSee also:Sephirotic WeaponsEach player will receive 1Fiend Totemper kill.
