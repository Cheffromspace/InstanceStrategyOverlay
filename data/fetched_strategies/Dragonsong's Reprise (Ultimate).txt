Below is simply a recommended strategy, but it is up to players and their groups to determine what works best for them.All throughout this battle, the arena will be surrounded by a border that will kill any player who touches it. Players should set their waymarks at the cardinals and intercardinals of the map, as they persist through the several changes of the arena. It is recommended that the waymarks are set with corresponding colors on opposite sides of the arena (for instance, “1” can be located at the north, and “A” can be located at the south). Players will want to divide into two light parties, with at least one player acting as a “pivot”, and again into partners, with one tank or healer for every DPS. For phase three, players should determine where they would like to have “one”, “two” and “three” marked players with “Elusive Jump” and “Spineshatter Dive” stand to mitigate confusion and allow for quick adjustments.Failing mechanics, if not outright killing the player, will inflict a crippling -50%Damage Downdebuff that lasts for 3 minutes, making the damage checks harder to pass. If the player does not need to immediately be alive for an upcoming mechanic, it is generally better to kill themselves by walking into the wall and then be revived, as theWeaknessdebuff is around half the damage loss versus theDamage Down.The total fight length is around 22 minutes (3 minutes for phase 1, 19 minutes for phases 2-7 post-checkpoint).Phase 1: SersAdelphel,Grinnaux, andCharibertAbilitiesHoliest of Holy: Cast byAdelphel, deals heavy room wide damage, and must be mitigated.Empty Dimension: Cast byGrinnaux. Casts a donut AoE with the only safe area within the boss's hitbox.Heavensblaze: Cast byCharibert. Hits one player with a small fire AoE dealing high damage that must be shared with additional mitigation.Holy Shield Bash: Cast byAdelphel. Tethers to a random player which can be exchanged to other players on contact. Will then charge at the tethered player and use this ability, dealing moderate damage and debuffing withDown for the Countand is followed up immediately byHoly Bladedance.Holy Bladedance: A heavy-damage multi-hit tankbuster with a small AoE that requires heavy mitigation or invulnerability cooldowns.Hyperdimensional Slash:Grinnauxmoves to the center of the arena and randomly targets four players with orange overhead markers. Shortly afterwards, he will fire a line cleave at each marked player, dealing high damage, debuffing withMagic Vulnerability Up, while firing a wide conal shared damage AoE directly behind him that must be shared by the unmarked players, dealing high damage and debuffing withMagic Vulnerability Upas well. The boss will turn and target the four players who were previously unmarked and repeat the attack. Each cleave fired at a player will leave a portal at the edge of the arena where the attack collided. This portal will tether to players if they get too close, dealing massive damage and inflictingDamage Down. If the portals are too close together, they will tether and explode, wiping the party. If they are placed too close to the cardinals of the arena,Adelphelwill charge through them later, exploding them and wiping the party.Faith Unmoving:Grinnauxwill cast this, knocking all players away a good distance and dealing light damage. The knockback can be prevented with anti-knockback abilities.Shining Blade / Bright Flare:Adelphelwill drop on the edge of the arena at a random cardinal, performHoliest of Holy, then dash to another cardinal, dropping several orbs that explode in a small AoE. From that new cardinal, he will dash across the arena, continuing to drop orbs. Finally, he will dash to another cardinal with more orbs. The movement pattern is a zig-zag. Orbs that are too close to Hyperdimensional Slash portals will tether and cause the portal to explode, wiping the party. The boss will immediately follow up withExecution.Execution:Adelpheltargets the highest player in hisenmitylist, and jumps on them, dealing high damage in a small AoE. Any other players aside from the primary target caught in this will be knocked back and instantly killed.Holiest Hallowing: Cast byAdelphel. A massive heal onGrinnauxthat needs to be interrupted withInterjectorHead Graze. This is cast three times in this phase.Holy Chain: Players are assigned a symbol and tethered together in pairs, also represented by theBurning Chainsdebuff, with each member in a pair assigned the same symbol. The chains must be broken by distance. Chains that are not broken in time will inflict massive damage andDamage Downto both tethered players, likely resulting in deaths due to the concurrentHeavensflame.Red Circle: Assigned to two DPS.Green Triangle: Assigned to one DPS and one healer.Purple Square: Assigned to one DPS and one tank.Blue X: Assigned to one tank and one healer.Heavensflame: Cast byCharibert. All players are hit by a large fire AoE, dealing high damage and debuffing withFire Resistance Down II, making overlap lethal.Full Dimension:Grinnauxfires a point-blank circular AoE with the safe region past max melee range.The Bull's Steel:Grinnaux'senrage. Takes roughly three seconds to cast, restoring Grinnaux to full health and giving him damage up and invincibility buffs.Brightblade's Steel:Adelphel'senrage. Takes roughly three seconds to cast, restoring Adelphel to full health and giving him damage up and invincibility buffs.Planar Prison: All players are tethered toGrinnauxand pulled into a small circular prison, dealing light damage. All players are inflicted withPlanar Imprisonment, which causes the player to instantly die if they attempt to exit the prison.Shockwave: Unavoidable constant partywide damage that pulses fromHaurchefant, but will stop when he dies.Brightwing: Cast byCharibert, cleaves the two closest players near him with small conal AoEs, dealing very high damage and debuffing withLight Resistance DownandSkyblind, which will drop a small invisible AoE at the player's present location when the debuff timer expires after 5 seconds. Shortly after, the AoE will detonate, inflicting lethal damage to anyone hit.Pure of Heart: A slow cast spell byCharibert. A partywide attack dealing damage based on how much HP Charibert has. Will wipe the party ifCharibert'sHP is above ~30%. Otherwise will deal high damage that requires mitigation.StrategyThe fight will open with SersAdelphel & Grinnauxas the only targetable bosses. Players should pull both bosses into the center of the arena and focus on keepingGrinnauxandAdelphelat roughly the same level of HP.Adelphelwill begin by castingHoliest of Holy, dealing heavy party-wide damage, andGrinnauxwill castEmpty Dimension, so players should move into his hitbox. Following this,Adelphelwill tether to a random player and begin castingHoly Shield Bash, which the off tank should pick up and turn away from the party. Once theHoly Shield Bash/Blade Dancecombo goes off,Charibertwill hit all players withHeavensblaze, dealing high damage, which should be mitigated and healed through.After a certain amount of time,Adelphelwill leave the arena andGrinnauxwill target four random players withHyperdimensional Slash. The four marked players should move to the northern end of the arena and space out, making sure not to stand in the cardinals or intercardinals, but somewhere in between to carefully position the portals to where they won't tether or get hit byAdelphellater. The remaining four players should group behind the boss to split the incoming attack and not get overlapped by the frontal cleaves. Once the attack fires, players in the rear will spread out to their nearest markers in the same way the first marked players did, and the attack will fire again. Players should be careful to avoid getting too close to the portals, as they will tether to them, deal massive damage (most likely killing the player), and deal aDamage Downdebuff, severely hindering them.Adelphelwill soon return to the arena, landing on a random cardinal of the arena and begin to castHoliest of Holy, dealing proximity-based damage.Grinnauxwill castFaith Unmoving, knocking players backwards a good distance. Players should use their knockback mitigation skills here and move away fromAdelphel. Next,Adelphelwill dash across a corner of the arena to the next cardinal, dropping exploding orbs of light where he passes. He will then dash across the arena, then across another corner, in a zig-zag. To avoid this, players should move towards the corner of the cardinal whereAdelphelfirst dashed to in order to avoid the explosions and future dash attacks. Once he stops dashing, the tank that is at the top of his enmity list should move away from the group, asAdelphelimmediately follows up withExecute, a tankbuster that deals high damage in an AoE. After these attacks resolve, the portals will fade.Players should move the bosses back to the center of the arena, and prepare to interruptHoliest Hallowing, a massive heal forGrinnauxcast byAdelphel.Grinnauxwill use a secondFaith Unmovingat this point, andAdelphelwill try to cast a secondHoliest Hallowing, which needs to be interrupted. For thisFaith Unmoving, each player will be marked with either a cross, a square, a circle or a triangle based on their role, and tethered to a player with the same symbol. There are several ways to handle this mechanic, and some players can try to pre-position based on their role, but there is plenty of time to adjust positioning as long as they move quickly. Players should move opposite the player with the same marker as them, and get knocked back from each other to break the tether. If the tether doesn't break, take a few steps towards the edge of the arena, then back in towards the center of the arena and spread out around the boss. Failing to break the tether in time will inflict massive damage on both players andDamage Down.Charibertwill castHeavensflame, hitting all players in a small AoE and inflictingFire Resistance Down II. If players overlap for this attack, they will die.Adelphelwill cast anotherHoliest of Holy, whileGrinnauxcasts eitherEmpty DimensionorFull Dimension. IfEmpty, players need to move intoGrinnaux'shitbox, and if itsFull, players need to move to max melee range. These attacks should be mitigated and healed through. Following this,Adelphelwill attempt to cast anotherHoliest Hallowing, which needs to be interrupted. At this point, players need to focus on burning down both bosses as fast as possible, and defeat them both at as close to the same time as possible. If players aren't able to defeat the bosses before the enrage timer, they will both cast their enrage abilities and wipe the party. If players defeat one boss, the other will immediately begin casting their enrage, and the party has around 3 seconds to defeat the remaining boss. Once both bosses are defeated, they leave the arena and reappear withChariberton the west side of the arena. The untargettableGrinnauxtethers all players to him and pulls them into aPlanar Prison, inflicting them withPlanar Imprisonment, which will kill players immediately if they leave the prison circle.At this point,Charibertwill begin castingPure of Heart, which will deal party-wide damage based on how much HP he has when the attack completes casting. He will also cleave the two closest players to him withBrightwing, dealing very high damage debuffing withLight Resistance DownandSkyblind, which will detonate after four seconds. To handle these mechanics, players need to take turns baiting the cleaves away from the party in rotation, with the party moving away from the boss, then moving towards him when the players get cleaved and move out to avoid getting hit by theSkyblinddebuff AoE. Players need to burn downCharibert'sHP as much as possible before his attack finishes casting. Players will noticeSer Zephirinappear on the east side of the arena and throw hisSpear of the Furyat the party, butHaurchefantrun into the arena and block the spear, which quickly drains his HP and kills him. This is a reference to a mechanic that players will have to handle later, but do not need to worry about for now. However, when Haurchefant is alive, he will constantly pulse out party-wide damage withShockwavethat should be healed through.OncePure of Heartcasts and as long as at least one player is alive, the arena will transition. TheLimit Breakgauge will reset, players will gain access to a thirdLimit Breakbar and a checkpoint, the only one in the encounter. Note that players must attackThordanfor the checkpoint to be registered. Wiping at any point for the remainder of the fight will cause the party to restart from the checkpoint, although resetting the instance will require defeating Phase 1 again to acquire the checkpoint.Phase 2:King Thordanand HisKnights TwelveAbilitiesAscalon's Mercy Concealed:Thordantargets all players with a narrow conal AoE that snapshots players' positions when the cast bar finishes and resolves shortly after.Ascalon's Might: Tankbuster. Three cleaves that deal heavy damage and require mitigation or an invulnerability skill.Strength of the Ward:Thordansummons hisKnights Twelveto perform a series of attacks.Spiral Thrust:Sers Ignasse, Vellguine, Paulecrainappear at the edge of the arena at random cardinals or intercardinals and charge across the arena, knocking back and killing anyone hit.Lightning Storm:Thordantargets every player with a medium-sized circle AoE, dealing moderate damage and debuffing withLightning Resistance Down II, making overlap lethal.Heavy Impact:Ser Guerriquecasts a point-blank AoE that slowly pulses outwards in donuts that get larger with each pulse. Being hit will inflict massive damage andStunin addition to theDamage Down.Conviction: Cast bySer Hermenost, spawns several towers around the arena in various patterns that must be soaked by one player each when the cast bar fills, or will explode and wipe the party.Skyward Leap: TheWard'sDragoonsleap into the air, targeting three players with a blue marker and dropping shortly after, dealing massive damage in a large circular AoE and inflicting bothPhysical Vulnerability UpandMagic Vulnerability Up.Dimensional Slash:Ser Grinnauxappears and spawns several black AoEs on the floor that slowly expand and eventually resolve. Being hit will inflict massive damage andHeavyin addition to theDamage Down.The Dragon's Rage:Thordantargets a random non-tank player without a blue marker with an untelegraphed split damage AoE.Holy Shield Bash/Holy Bladedance:Sers Adelphel & Janlenouxwill each tether a random player without a blue marker, and once the cast finishes, dash to the currently tethered players and useHoly Shield Bash, inflictingDown for the Countto them and anyone too close to them, then follow up withHoly Bladedance, a multi-hit high damage conal tankbuster that requires heavy mitigation. The tethers can be exchanged with other players by contacting the tether. Damage can be mitigated with increased distance from the knights.Ancient Quaga: Unavoidable high damage party-wide attack that must be mitigated.Heavenly Heel: Tankbuster that debuffs withSlashing Resistance Down. This is followed up byAscalon's Might, requiring a tank swap or invulnerability cooldown to survive.Sanctity of the Ward: Summons theKnights Twelveonce again for several more attacks.The Dragon's Gaze:Thordanmoves to the edge of the arena and begins casting a gaze attack that deals heavy damage and inflictsHysteria, causing players to lose control and run about randomly.The Dragon's Glory: An Eye spawns at the edge of the arena and uses an untelegraphed gaze attack at the same time asThe Dragon's Gazethat deals heavy damage and inflictsHysteria, causing players to lose control and run about randomly.Sacred Sever:Ser Zephirintargets two random players with either one or two sword markers, indicating who will be attacked first and second. The attack repeats twice. Will inflict very high damage andPhysical Vulnerability Upin a medium-sized AoE that is reduced by distance from Zephirin. The damage should be shared among four players with heavy mitigation.Shining Blade / Bright Flare:Sers Adelphel and Janlenouxappear in the center of the arena, and dash to opposite sides, dropping large orbs that explode in large AoEs. Both players then dash to opposite ends of the arena, dropping orbs once again.Holy Comet:Ser Noudenetwill mark two random players based on their role (either two supports, or two DPS) with a red overhead marker and thePreydebuff, and sequentially drop seven meteors on each player shortly afterward. Each meteor drop will deal light raidwide damage. If the meteors land too close to one another, they will explode (Holy Impact) and wipe the party.Hiemal Storm:Ser Haumericwill target four players of the same role (DPS or supports) with an untelegraphed, large circular AoE that leaves behind a large persistent ice puddle. The damage from the initial attack must be split with two players each and will inflictIce Resistance DownIIamong all players hit, making overlap lethal. The ice puddles will inflictFrostbiteto anyone who steps or lingers in them around a second after they appear, dealing massive damage over time.The Heaven's Stake:Ser Chariberttelegraphs four large fire AoEs around the intercardinals of arena, and a massive fire donut that covers the edge of the arena. The four circle AoEs will leave behind fire puddles that will inflictBurnsto anyone who steps or lingers in them around a second after they appear, dealing massive damage over time.Faith Unmoving:Ser Grinnauxappears and performs a knockback from the center of the arena, dealing light raidwide damage. The knockback can be prevented bySurecastorArm's Length.Ultimate End: An attack that deals massive damage and must be mitigated in order to survive.Broad Swing:Thordanfaces a random player then does three sequential cleaves, each hitting a third of the arena. Will always cleave either his top right or top left first. Will inflict massive damage,Damage Down, and knock back any players hit.Aetheric Burst: Enrage. If players do not defeatThordanbefore this attack fires, the party will be wiped.Note that any shields applied to the party will be instantly removed when the cast bar fills, but there is a slight delay until the attack kills players.StrategyAt the beginning of the phase, players should pullThordaninto the center of the arena to better handle coming mechanics. He will start withAscalon's Mercy, so the main tank should stand directly in front of him while the rest of the party stands behind to bait the cleaves, then move out of the way just before the cast bar finishes. Following this,Thordanwill useAscalon's Might, a massive three-hit cleave tankbuster with no castbar. The main tank should mitigate this or use an invulnerability skill and healers should be ready. After a few moments he will move to the center of the arena (if not there already) and begin castingStrength of the Ward, summoning the otherKnight's Twelveto the arena and becoming intangible after the cast.For this portion of the phase, players simply need to concern themselves with avoiding mechanics, as no target will be available. After all the knights jump away, the threeDragoonknights,Sers Ignasse, Vellguine, and Paulecrainwill appear around the edge of the arena at either the cardinals or intercardinals, then shortly after dash across the arena in a straight line. Players should look for the area where there is no knight behind or in front of them at either edge of the arena to avoid this. At the same time,Thordanwill castLightning Storm, targeting all players. In order to handle these attacks, players should identify the two safe zones and separate into their light parties. Once in the safe zones, they should spread out in a triangle shape, with three players against the edge of the arena spread apart, and another closer to the center of the arena. Players need to be careful not to get clipped by theSpiral Thrust, as their attacks are quite wide. Players must also space out for theLightning Stormattack, as the attack deals high damage and debuffs withLightning Resistance Down II, meaning overlap will kill. At the same time these attacks are happening,Ser Guerriquewill charge up and useHeavy Impact, creating four large shockwave earth attacks that slowly move outwards. getting hit by this will deal high damage and debuff withStun, most likely leading to a death. to avoid this, once the animation for the shockwave starts playing, players can move into that area and safely avoid damage.Thordanwill reappear in the center of the arena again and prepare anotherAscalon's Might Concealed. To handle this, players will have to line up to bait the cleaves and move like before. Following this,Ser Grinnauxwill appear and begin castingDimensional Slash, causing several dark portals to spawn on the ground that begin to slowly grow.Sers Adelphel & Janlenoux, the twoPaladinswill drop in the center of the arena and turn to face a certain direction. This indicates whereThordanwill land. The tanks should stand next to these knights to pick up their tethers. Three random players will also receive blue impact markers over their heads, indicating that the threeDragoonknights will soon drop on them usingSkyward Leap. Players can identify three safe areas on the edge of the arena where they can stand to take these attacks by looking where the portals on the floor won't reach the edge of the arena, while the remaining three players move to stand at the edge of the arena in front ofThordan. Once thePaladinsdrop their tethers and the tanks pick them up, they can move to either side of the safe area nearThordan. Once they reach the safe area,Thordanwill begin castingThe Dragon's Rage, which will require the three players to stack to mitigate damage. ThePaladinknights will then rush to the tanks and use theHoly Shield Bash/Holy Bladedancecombo. players who are not the tanks should be sure to move out of the area, as this attack can clip anyone who is too close. To handle this attack, the tanks should either use their invulnerability skill or pop their defensive cooldowns. Healers should be ready to top the tanks off.Thordanwill return to the center of the arena and immediately begin castingAncient Quaga, dealing high party-wide damage, so healers should be ready for this. Following this,Thordanwill useHeavenly Heel, a heavy-hitting tankbuster that inflicts the main tank withSlashing Resistance Down. This is immediately followed up byAscalon's Might, which will kill the tank unless swapped or an invulnerability skill is used. After this,Thordanwill return to the center and useSanctity of the Ward, another series of mechanics. Once all the knights have lept from the center of the arena, the twoPaladinknights andSer ZephirintheDark Knightwill spawn, and a large Eye will appear off the edge of the arena. Thordan will land around the arena's edge as well. Two players will be marked with either one sword or two sword markers. The twoPaladinswill dash to opposite sides of the arena, then dash on a diagonal to the north and south, droppingBrightorbsboth ways. During this, theDark Knightwill useSacred Severon the first marked player, then the second, then back to the first, and back to the second. Each hit ofSacred Severmust be split amongst other players to mitigate.To handle these mechanics, players must quickly identify which direction the knights are facing in relation to the north of the arena. The knights will appear staggered, with one closer to the north of the arena then the other. If the knight closer to the north if facing north, the knights will dash clockwise. Otherwise, they will move counterclockwise. After this, players should move into their light parties, and make sure only one member of each party has a marker. If two players in a light party have a marker, one of them must swap with the other team, as they will not survive two back-to-back attacks. Try to make sure that both parties are balanced at four players, as surviving the attacks at 3 players is very difficult. It helps to have a person in each party who acts as a pivot to the other team should the need to swap arise. Players will also need to watch where the Eye andThordanspawn, as both will be casting a gaze attack that will inflictHysteriaif hit by it.Once parties have been corrected, one party will move to behind theDark Knight, and the other will move opposite. Once the gaze attacks fire, the knight's will begin dashing and theDark Knightwill begin attacking. Players will need to move around the edge of the arena in the same direction as thePaladinknights to avoid theBrightorbsleft behind.Once the knight's attacks have been resolved, theMageknights will appear, and the next set of mechanics begins. Four large persistent fire puddles will spawn, four players will be targeted for ice puddles, and two will receivePreymarkers, indicating they will deal with meteors. Eight towers will also be summoned around the arena, some near the edge and some in the middle of the arena.To handle these mechanics, players will need to meet up with their partners, with thePreymarked players to the north and south. The ice marked players should be positioned between the fire puddle AoEs without being too close to the edge of the arena, as meteor players will be moving through there soon. Once the puddles are dropped, the pillars will spawn. The players handling meteors will begin moving around the edge of the arena in opposite directions, making sure not to useSprintor overlap the meteors, as they will explode if they are too close together. To handle the towers, players should focus on the quadrant of the arena they are in. The players handling the meteors will grab the outer towers, and the other players will grab the outer towers in their quadrant. The other players will check their quadrant, and move to any towers that remain. While moving around players will need to be careful not to touch the puddles, as they deal high damage and debuff with aResistance Downof their element, and kill on the second touch. The meteors as they land will deal light party-wide damage, so healers may want to raise barriers or top up on healing for this.A second set of towers will spawn at the edge of the arena at the cardinals and intercardinals. The meteor marked players will grab the towers on the opposite side of the arena from where they started, at the north and south. The other players in their role should take the other cardinal towers to the east and west, with the other roles taking the intercardinals.Ser Grinnauxwill appear at this time and begin chargingFaith Unmoving, which deals a knockback. Players on the outside of the arena will need to use their knockback mitigation to avoid being sent into the walls, while players in the center of the arena can use this to their advantage to get knocked into their towers hitbox.Once all the attacks resolve,Thordanwill become targetable again and appear to the north of the arena and begin castingUltimate End. Players will need to inflict damage mitigation on the boss, as well as set up several defensive mitigations and shields to survive the attack, as it deals a massive amount of damage. Healers should be prepared for this. Following this attack,Thordangains theDiscomposeddebuff, increasing his damage taken by 30%. He will move into the arena, using twoBroad Swings. To avoid these, simply move behind the boss, then after the first swing, move into where the hitbox for that attack was. After two of these, the boss will begin to castAetheric Burstas an enrage.Thordanmust be defeated before this cast finishes, or the party will be wiped. Upon defeatingThordan, Players should group up and use heavy mitigation, as the phase transition to phase 3 deals high damage. Note that if Thordan is defeated when the animation for his enrage goes off, any shields on the party will be deleted and will need to be immediately re-applied for the transition into the next phase.Phase 3:NidhoggNote that in this phase, the boss cannot be moved, but he will turn to face the highest enmity player if not casting an action, which is important for orienting for some mechanics.AbilitiesFinal Chorus: The boss drops down on the party at the beginning of the phase, dealing massive raid damage that must be mitigated.Dive from Grace: Each player is marked with a specific number over their heads, ranging from one to three (First in Line,Second in Line,Third in Line). Three random players will be marked with 1, two players will be marked with 2, and the remaining three players will be marked with 3. These debuffs indicate what order theNidhogg Cloneswill dive on them when the debuff timer expires. Once the cast bar fills, players are then marked with a specificJumpdebuff, indicating where a tower will spawn after theClonesdive. The tower will spawn around 3 seconds after the clone dives. Each clone dive will inflict heavy damage,Fire Resistance Down IIandPhysical Vulnerability Upto the targeted players, in a medium-sized AoE. Players who are caught in others' clone dives will be knocked back and instantly die.Dark High Jump(circle): Dives on the player, and places a tower where they are standing.Dark Elusive Jump(downwards arrow): Dives on the player, and places a tower 10 yalms behind their hitbox based on which direction they are facing.Dark Spineshatter Dive(upwards arrow): Dives on the player, and places a tower 10 yalms in front of their hitbox based on which direction they are facing.These are assigned per number group. At least one, but no more than two number groups will have arrows, while the remaining group(s) will have all circles. A group containing arrows will always contain one of each arrow, with the remaining player (if not group two) given a circle.Darkdragon Dive: ANidhogg Clonedrops on a tower that requires one player to soak, or it will explode and wipe the party around 1.5 seconds after the tower appears. The player who is soaking the tower will take light damage and be inflicted withFire Resistance Down IIandPhysical Vulnerability Up. If a player with these debuffs soaks a tower, they will die.A later variant will spawn four towers at the intercardinals in melee range of the boss. These require multiple players to soak to prevent them from exploding ~5 seconds after spawning. Towers may require one to four players, as indicated by the number of pillars within the tower circle. The pattern of these is random, but there will always be a total of 8 pillars. If fewer than the required number of players soak a given tower, it will explode and wipe the party.Gnash and Lash / Lash and Gnash: The boss will use three sequential attacks: a stack AoE, followed by an attack either within its hitbox, or outside, depending on the name of the cast. Being hit by the latter two attacks will inflict a small amount of damage, knock the player back slightly, and inflict a cripplingDamage Downdebuff.Eye of the Tyrant: A high-damage stack AoE that randomly targets one person in front of Nidhogg. Should be shared by five players with additional party mitigation to lower damage.Lashing Wheel: A donut AoE that hits the entire arena except for inside the boss's hitbox.Gnashing Wheel: A point-blank circular AoE that hits inside the boss's hitbox, making the outside safe.In other words,Gnash and Lash: stack -> out -> in.Lash and Gnash: stack -> in -> outGeirskogul: Line AoEs fired by theNidhogg Clonesthat bait to the closest player to the clone once they spawn from Darkdragon Dive tower soaks. The direction of the attack is locked in once the cast bar appears on the enemy list.Drachenlance:Nidhoggwill turn towards a random player and fire a point-blank conal AoE that deals lethal damage. He will always turn south when he uses this ability the second time.Soul Tether:Nidhoggand a randomNidhogg Clonespawned from the last set ofDarkdragon Divetowers will each tether a random player. This clone will not useGeirskogul. The tethers can be exchanged to other players on contact. A few seconds after the tethers appear, both will use a heavy-hitting AoE tankbuster on the tethered players. Requires heavy mitigation (70% + and shields) or invulnerability cooldowns to survive.Revenge of the Horde: Enrage. The boss must be defeated before this cast completes, or the party will be wiped.StrategyPlayers should group in the center of the arena and pop several mitigations to handle the damage output fromFinal Chorus. Following this, the main tank should grab the boss and face them away from the party. The boss will perform three auto attacks, which are small cleaves, so other players should stack behind the boss. After this, the boss will begin castingDive from Grace, and each player will be targeted with a marker ranging from one to three:. These marks indicate which order players will have aNidhogg Clonedropped on them. Players will carry this debuff through the entire phase. Players will also receive one of three debuffs:High Jump Target(indicated by a debuff with a blue circle),Elusive Jump Target(indicated by a debuff with an arrow that points downwards), andSpineshatter Dive Target(indicated by a debuff with an arrow that points upwards). This indicates where a tower will appear once the attack is completed, and there is no limit to how many of each debuff is given to the party (for instance, each player can receive aHigh Jump Targetdebuff, meaning they can stand and face any direction around the boss). Once both debuffs have been given to players, they will need to move to their predetermined locations around the boss and face the specified direction to drop their towers. Players will have roughly nine seconds to adjust their location. Once the clones drop on them, they will need to move out and have a player marked with theThirddebuff to take their tower, as theClonelanding on a player inflictsFire Resistance Down II, and they will die if they try to soak their own tower.During this, the boss will castLash and Gnash, requiring players to move into the boss's hitbox, then out to avoid the attack. This is preceded by an untelegraphed stack attack. To handle these mechanics, the players marked with "one" will move to their locations based on theirJumpdebuff, while the players marked with "two" and "three" stack in front of the boss to mitigateDark Spineshatter Dive. Players will then move in, and back out of the boss's hitbox. Following this, the "three" marked players will move into their predetermined locations, both to soak the tower and place their own towers, while the "two" marked players move to their own predetermined locations to prepare to drop their towers.For the next set of towers, as mentioned prior, the "two" players will move to their predetermined location to drop their towers, and the "three" players will move to their predetermined locations based on theirJumpmarker and face the correct location. The "three" marked players will also need to face outwards away from the boss immediately following theNidhogg Clonesattack, as they will mimic the player. Once they begin castingGeirskogul, they will lock in place and begin firing their line AoEs. These need to be pointed outwards so players can avoid them, as getting hit will result in a death.While theGeirskogulcasts are resolving, the boss will begin casting anotherGnash/Lashcombo in either order, so players will need to determine the correct movement for the attack. "2" marked players will have theirNidhogg Clonesdrop on them, then will have to move in to stack with other players to mitigate anotherDark Spineshatter Dive, then two of the "one" marked players will soak the "two" players towers, facing outwards to bait theNidhogg Clonesonce again, and moving into the boss's hitbox as needed. Finally, the "two" players and the "one" player who didn't previously take a tower will handle the "three" marked players towers and bait theNidhogg Clonesa final time.After the towers resolve, the boss will turn towards a random player and begin castingDrachenlance, a point-blank conal cleave. Simply move behind the boss once this attack goes off. Another two auto-attacks will come out, and the boss will spawn four groups of tower puddles at the intercardinals of the arena, with varying numbers of towers within. The total number of towers spawned will always equal eight, and at least one will appear in each puddle, however, each puddle can have up to four towers within.To handle the new towers, players should have the healers and ranged DPS move to each intercardinal, and have the tanks and melee DPS adjust in order to handle this mechanic. Players will need to be communicative with where they are moving, as the towers will dropNidhogg Clonesfairly quickly. Once the towers are soaked the clones will need to be baited by anyone in the circle other than the tanks, who will need to move out and gather the tethers from both the boss and one of theNidhogg Clones. After a short while, both the boss and the clone will useSoul Tether, an untelegraphed tankbuster that hits in a small AoE. This attack deals massive damage, and will kill anyone else hit by it, and will only be survivable if the tank uses their mitigation or an invulnerability skill. Healers should be ready to heal the tanks following this.Following this, the boss will use a few more auto-attacks and anotherDrachenlance, and then will begin slow castingRevenge of the Horde, the boss's enrage. Players will need to defeat the boss before this attack fires or they will be wiped. Some parties may initially find it necessary to use a Melee Limit Break to defeat the boss before it enrages. While this is an option when still progressing on this phase and the next one, using a Limit Break at this point in the fight will prevent further progress at a later phase, so players must eventually be able to defeat Nidhogg without relying on a Limit Break in order to complete the encounter.Following the boss being defeated, players will need to stack once again to receive a buff to help deal with the Eyes in the intermission.Phase 4: TheEyes of NidhoggBoth Eyes are stationary enemies that cannot be moved and have omnidirectional hitboxes. TheRight Eye(blue) will always spawn west at 50% maximum HP and theLeft Eye(red) will always spawn east at 100% HP.AbilitiesSoul of Friendship: Haurchefant's spirit will tether a random player and cause a medium-sized AoE to appear from them. All players in the AoE will receive a buff that allows them to damage theRight Eye. The buff is lost on death.Soul of Devotion: Ysayle's spirit will tether Alphinaud and cause a medium-sized AoE to appear from him. All players in the AoE will receive a buff that allows them to damage theLeft Eye. The buff is lost on death.Resentment: Party-wide damage that inflicts aBleeddebuff that lasts six seconds.Hatebound: Each eye will tether four random players with one of two different colored chains (red or blue). Players with opposite colored chains can exchange by standing on each other, but will inflict them with a three second debuff (Bound and Determined) that prevents further chain exchange until it expires.Clawbound(red): Damage taken will result in damage to theLeft Eye.Fangbound(blue): Damage taken will result in healing to theRight Eye.Flare Nova: Two large yellow orbs will spawn, one next to each eye, which will grow in size four times before exploding and wiping the party. Must be soaked by two players at once, inflicting more damage as the orb grows. Will inflictFire Resistance Down II.Flare Star: Four small blue orbs will spawn, two next to each eye, which will grow in size four times before exploding and wiping the party. Must be soaked by one player each, inflicting more damage after the orb grows. Will inflictFire Resistance Down II.Mirage Dive: Cast by both eyes. Two random players withClawboundwill be hit with a medium-sized AoE that inflicts heavy damage andPiercing Resistance Down, making an additional hit from Mirage Dive lethal until the debuff expires. Will repeat three times. Players who are not the primary target of a Mirage Dive will be knocked back and instantly die, if caught in one.Steep in Rage: Heavy party-wide damage cast from both eyes and requires mitigation. Will kill players if both eyes cast this at once, requiring the Right Eye to be defeated before this cast finishes.Revenge of the Horde: Enrage. If both eyes are not defeated beforeNidhogg's Influencereaches 100,Nidhoggwill appear in his dragon form and cast this ability, wiping the party.StrategyWhen the phase begins, players should group up aroundAlphinaud, asHaurchefantandYsaylewill appear, targeting a random player andAlphinaudto each drop a buff,Soul of Friendship, andSoul of Devotion. Each buff will allow a player to inflict damage on a specific eye. Players need to obtain both buffs, and need to be careful not to die, as they will not be able to deal damage for the remainder of the fight, even if they are revived. Once players receive their buffs, they should break into their light parties, with each tank taking an eye. Players will need to spread out around the eyes.Estinienwill pulse outResentment, dealing party-wide damage that also inflicts a Bleed damage over time for a few seconds. Healers should be ready for this. Both eyes will castHatebound, tethering four random players to each eye. These tethers can be exchanged by players passing over one another, with a brief three second cooldown before chains can be exchanged again. Players with thebluechain will heal theRight Eyewhen they receive damage, while players with theredchain will deal damage to theLeft Eyewhen they receive damage. In order to meet the damage check for this phase, players with thebluechain must avoid taking damage when possible, while players with theredchain must take non-lethal damage when possible.For the first mechanic, two large yellow orbs will spawn at either side of the arena next to the eyes, and four smaller blue orbs, one to the north and south of each eye. each orb will expand four times, exploding on the fourth growth. The yellow orbs must be soaked by two players before they explode and kill the party. The blue orbs function in the same manner. To handle these orbs, two players with red tethers must soak the yellow orbs on their third growth, before they explode, dealing heavy damage to both themselves and theLeft Eye. One way to handle this is to have the tanks and melee DPS players take the red chains and soak each orb. If one of these players doesn't have the correct tether, they will need to swap tethers. The best way to do this is to have players with the incorrect tether move to the center of the arena (stacking on Estinien) so they are all able to swap. Players who need to swap should stay still once they are on Estinien and not "wiggle" until their debuff swaps, because the swaps are not always immediate. Healers and ranged DPS will take the blue tethers and position themselves at the north and south of their respective eyes, in line with the blue orbs. Once the tanks and melee DPS soak the yellow orbs in pairs, they will move to where they healer and ranged DPS are to pass their tether, then move directly under the eye. The healers and ranged DPS will each take their blue orbs.Following this, the eyes will both castMirage Dive, dropping a mid-sized circle AoE on two random players with a red tether, dealing heavy damage and inflicting aPiercing Resistance Down, meaning that being hit by a secondDivewill kill them. Players hit by the AoE will also die, so proper spacing is required. This mechanic will repeat three times. To handle this, all players should move towards theRight Eye, as theLeft Eyewill be taking damage with eachMirage Dive. The healers and ranged DPS, who have red tethers, will surround theRight Eye, standing max melee range at the intercardinals of it. The tanks and melee DPS, who have blue tethers, should stack directly on the eye. When the first two players are hit withDives, the two tanks will take the tethers of the players hit, with one tank scanning from northeast going clockwise to find the player they need to swap with, and the other tank scanning from northwest going counterclockwise. To make sure the tethers are passed correctly, the players moving out from the eye will move to the red tethered players' position. When the swaps resolve, the players who swapped to blue will move back to stack with theRight Eye. When the next set of players are hit, the melee DPS will take those tethers, and finally the two players (the "flex players") who were first hit will take the final set of tethers. The flex players should communicate who will take which tether, or have a priority system set up beforehand, as there is not enough time for one player to correct themselves if both flex players attempt to go to the same player to swap. After the fourth set of dives, the mechanic is finished.Immediately after, both eyes will begin castingSteep in Rage, a heavy-hitting party-wide AoE. If both casts go off at once, the party will be wiped. Players will need to finish off theRight Eye(blue) before the cast is finished, mitigate the damage from the remaining eye's cast, then immediately focus on theLeft Eye(red). Healers should be ready to heal the party. Once the other eye castsSteep in Rage, theRight Eyewill resurrect with minimal HP because players with blue chains took damage, so a ranged DPS can focus on taking it out. Both eyes will need to be defeated before theNidhogg's Influencereaches 100, or the party will be wiped out. Similar to the previous phase, a Limit Break must not be used to help clear this phase, as it will prevent further progress in the encounter. If both eyes are defeated in time, a short cutscene will play and transition into the next phase.Intermission:Alternate History VaultAbilitiesPlanar Prison: All players are tethered toGrinnauxand pulled into a small circular prison, dealing light damage. All players are inflicted withPlanar Imprisonment, which causes the player to instantly die if they attempt to exit the prison.Shockwave: Unavoidable constant partywide damage that pulses fromHaurchefant, and will stop if he dies.Brightwing: Cast byCharibert, cleaves the two closest players near him with small conal AoEs, dealing very high damage and debuffing withLight Resistance DownandSkyblind, which will drop a small invisible AoE at the player's present location when the debuff timer expires after 5 seconds. Shortly after, the AoE will detonate, inflicting lethal damage to anyone hit.Pure of Heart: A slow cast spell byCharibert. A partywide attack dealing damage based on how much HP Charibert has. Will wipe the party ifCharibert'sHP is above ~30%. Will otherwise inflict high damage that requires mitigation. Haurchefant, if alive, will also be damaged heavily by this attack.Pierce: Enrage. TheSpear of the Furywill kill Haurchefant once this cast resolves, looping the party back to Phase 2.StrategyThis intermission phase plays out almost exactly the same as the final part of phase one;Charibertwill begin castingPure of Heartand cleaving the two closest players withBrightwing. Players will need to handle this attack as before, moving in to bait the attack, then moving to the edge of the circle to handle the AoEs that explode following the resolution of the debuffSkyblind. Players will need to reduceCharibert'sHP as much as possible to mitigate how much damage the party takes fromPure of Heart, up to 24%. The difference this time is that players should have access toLimit Break Level Three, assuming it was not used earlier in the battle. WhenHaurchefantshows up to block theSpear of the Fury, a tank must use their third levelLimit breakto ensure he survives. He will take significantly reduced damage as long as the buff is up. He will also be healable, and must be kept alive. If Haurchefant is kept alive, he will pulse outShockwaveraid damage for the duration of the Planar Prison sequence, making healing more challenging than the final part of phase one. The party should distribute mitigations appropriately. Haurchefant must be near full health oncePure of Heartcasts because it will also deal significant damage to him. Afterwards, the Planar Prison will dissipate, and players must move toHaurchefantand quickly destroy theSpear of the Fury.TheSpearwill begin castingPierce, which will killHaurchefantif it completes casting, sending players back to phase 2, where they will wipe. Once the spear has been broken, the battle will continue after another short cutscene, transitioning to another arena.Phase 5: Dark King ThordanAbilitiesIncarnation: Revives the three Dragons around the arena.The Dragon's Eye:Thordancasts this, increasing his damage output withLight of Ascalon.Wrath of the Heavens:Thordancalls upon hisKnightsand theDragonsto perform a series of mechanics.Twisting Dive:Vedrfolnirwill land at a cardinal somewhere around the edge of the arena, then charge across to the other side after a short cast, knocking back and killing anyone in his path. Following this, each player will drop a smallTwisterwhere they were standing. If players come into contact with this, it will explode, instantly killing them and knocking nearby players into the edge of the arena, also killing them.Spiral Pierce: Two random players will be tethered to, and theKnightswill dash to them after a short while, dealing high proximity damage in a line AoE and inflictingMagic Vulnerability Up.Chain Lightning: Two players will be hit by this attack, debuffing them withThunderstruck. When the debuff resolves, it will deal lightning damage in a small AoE around the afflicted player, and any other player hit by this will take massive damage and receive aParalysisdebuff in addition toDamage Down.Skyward Leap: A player will receive a blue marker over their head, and shortly after will have a large AoE drop on them, dealing high damage and inflicting bothMagic Vulnerability Upand a very shortPhysical Vulnerability Up.Cauterize(with marker): A player will receive a green divebomb marker over their head, indicating whereVidofnirandDarkscalewill dive to when the marker disappears. When the cast resolves,VidofnirandDarkscalewill divebomb to this position, knocking back and killing any who are hit by them.Ascalon's Mercy Revealed: Each player will be hit with a conal AoE fromThordanin the middle that deals damage and debuffs withPhysical Vulnerability Up, making overlap lethal.Liquid Heaven: A random player that was not targeted forSkyward LeaporSpiral Piercewill be targeted byVedrfolnir, who will spit five fireballs at the player, with each spit dealing moderate damage and dropping a large persistent fire puddle. The fire puddles will inflictBurnsto anyone who steps or lingers in them around a second after they appear, killing them shortly after. Any player withMagic Vulnerability Upwho is hit by the fireball spits will die. If the original target for this attack dies,Vedrfolinirwill randomly target other players with each subsequent fireball.Altar Flare:Charibertwill target a player who will begin dropping large fire AoEs under them, totaling up to four. The AoEs will soon erupt, killing any who are within. If the original target for this attack dies,Charibertwill randomly target other players with each subsequent AoE.Empty Dimension:Grinnauxwill cast a donut AoE that covers the entire arena, with the only safe zone within his hitbox.Ancient Quaga: Unavoidable high damage party-wide AoE. Heal through and heavily mitigate.Heavenly Heel: Delivers an attack that deals high damage and aSlashing Resistance Downdebuff, followed by three heavy-hitting tankbuster cleaves known asAscalon's Might.Death of the Heavens:Thordansummons hisKnightsand theDragonsonce again to perform another series of attacks.Doom: Four random players will be inflicted with a twenty five secondDoom, which will kill them if the debuff expires. These players will have a dark red aura around them when the debuff is active, for easy visual identification. The debuff can be removed by stepping into a small white puddle which is left behind by eachWings of Salvationmedium-sized white AoE.Spear of the Fury:Zephirinwill throw a spear in a line AoE through the center of the arena. Anyone hit will take massive damage and be inflicted withHP Recovery Down.Cauterize(without marker):Darkscalewill charge through the center of the arena in a line AoE from his starting position, knocking back and killing anyone hit.Heavy Impact:Gerriquewill cast this, with the attack starting as a point-blank earthquake AoE that will expand into donut AoEs that gradually grow wider. Being hit will inflict massive damage andStunin addition to theDamage Down.Lightning Storm:Thordantargets all players with a small AoE for medium damage and inflictsLightning Resistance Down, making overlapping lethal.Wings of Salvation: Cast byVidofnir. The four players who are not afflicted withDoomwill be targeted with medium-sized white circle AoEs that will soon resolve and kill anyone inside. The large puddles will leave behind smaller puddles that will cleanseDoomfor anyone who steps inside, which will consume the puddles. They can still be consumed by players who step in them withoutDoom.Holy Chain: Players are assigned a symbol and tethered together in pairs, also represented by theBurning Chainsdebuff, with each member in a pair assigned the same symbol. The chains must be broken by distance. Chains that are not broken in time will inflict massive damage andDamage Downto both tethered players.Red Circle: Assigned to the two farthest players from the center with Doom.Green Triangle: Assigned to one player with Doom and one player without Doom.Purple Square: Assigned to one player with Doom and one player without Doom.Blue X: Assigned to two players without Doom.Faith Unmoving: Players are knocked back towards the edge of the arena from the middle.The Dragon's Gaze:Thordancasts a gaze ability, inflicting heavy damage and debuffing withHysteriaandDamage Downif players are looking at him when the cast resolves.The Dragon's Glory: A large Dragon's Eye spawns on the edge of the arena and uses an untelegraphed gaze ability at the same time asThe Dragon's Gaze, inflicting heavy damage and debuffing withHysteriaandDamage Downif players are looking at it when the cast resolves.Heavensflame:Chariberthits all players with a large fire AoE that deals high damage and inflicts a briefFire Resistance Down II, making an overlap lethal. Requires some mitigation.Holy Meteor: Eight meteor circles spawn around the arena, one on each cardinal and intercardinal, indicating where a meteor will fall. They must be destroyed or they will wipe the party.Aetheric Burst: Enrage. Thordan must be reduced to less than three percent HP before this cast finishes or the party will wipe.StrategyThordanwill appear at the center of the arena and immediately castIncarnation, resurrecting and taking control of the three Dragons in the arena. Following this,Thordanwill castThe Dragon's Eyeand buff himself. He will then use two auto-attacks that should be mitigated as they deal high damage. Following this, he will castWrath of the Heavens, summoning hisKnights Twelveand the Dragons. For the following mechanics, players need only worry about correctly dodging the various attacks as the boss will not be targetable.To start,Vedrfolnirwill spawn at the edge of the arena and begin castingTwisting Dives, two of the knights will tether to two random players, a singular player will receive a blue marker over their head, indicating aknightwill drop an AoE on them, and two random players will be hit byChain Lightning. OnceTwisting Divescompletes, the Dragon will charge across the arena at the same time as theKnightsmove to the player they are tethered to. Shortly after the charge, each player will have aTwisterspawn underneath them, as their location was snapshotted just beforeVedrfolnircharged. Another player will then receive a green marker over their head, indicating they will be attacked byVidofnir, andThordanwill useAscalon's Mercy Revealed. A player will be targeted byDarkscaleforLiquid Heaven, while another player will be targeted forAltar Flare.Thordanwill useAscalon's Mercy Revealed, andGrinnauxwill begin castingEmpty Dimension.Darkscalewill begin firing five fireballs, the player targeted forAltar Flarewill begin dropping puddles, and the two Dragons will begin castingCauterize. FinallyEmpty Dimensionwill fire in a large donut AoE. The mechanic will finish withThordancastingAncient Quagafor a roomwide AoE.To handle these mechanics, players must first identify whereVedrfolnirhas landed and treat this as "relative north", then clear a space on the other side of the arena for its charge.  Tethered players will move to the opposite side of the arena to theKightthey are tethered to, while the player with the blue marker moves to the  "relative west" of the Dragon. The remaining players will move to the "relative east" edge of the arena to avoid the wide lines these attacks have. TheChain Lightning,Defamation,Twisting DiveandSpiral Piercewill all fire around the same time. Once the Dive has resolved, players should move immediately from where they are standing to avoid theTwisterthat spawns there. The player with the greenDivebombshould move towardsCharibertthe mage knight and drop this at the edge of the arena. Every player will then spread out at the edge of the arena to handleAscalon's Mercy Revealed, then wait for both the AoEs fromAltar Flareand theLiquid Heavenfireballs to begin appearing. The player who begins droppingAltar FlareAoEs will move clockwise around the edge of the arena, and the player who is hit byLiquid Heavenwill begin doing so as well. All other players will move towardsGrinnauxand position themselves either nearThordanif they are not debuffed withThunderstruck, or towards the edge of the arena and spread out if they are. Players can use the dark runic circles on the floor of the arena to determine how close or how far to stand. OnceEmpty Dimensionfires, players can group up for healing and mitigation to deal withAncient Quaga. At this point,Thordanwill become targetable once again.The boss will use an auto-attack, then castHeavenly Heel, dealing heavy damage and debuffing the tank withSlashing Resistance Down. He will then follow up withAscalon's Might, forcing a tankswap to avoid taking lethal damage. This will then lead intoDeath of the Heavens.ForDeath of the Heavens, players need to locate the warriorGuerriqueand treat him once again as "relative north". Four random players will be afflicted withDoom, these players will move towards the "relative north" of the arena, while the other players will move to the "relative south.Vedrfolnirwill appear on the edge again and begin castingTwisting Diveagain. Players will need to spread out near the waymarkers (but slightly off of them) to avoid the incoming attacks.Thordanwill castLightning Storm, dropping an AoE on each player that will kill if overlapped due to theLightning Resistance Down II,Vidofnirwill castWings of Salvation, dropping white puddles under non-Doomedplayers,Darkscalewill charge across the arena withCauterize, and the first AoE ofHeavy Impactwill come out. Once the second AoE fires, players should move from their current position to avoid theTwistersthat spawn, and move towards the center of the arena to avoid the third AoE fromHeavy Impact. At this point, aDragon's Eyewill spawn somewhere on the edge of the arena and begin castingThe Dragon's GlorywhileThordancaststhe Dragon's Gaze. Players need to identify where both of these attacks are coming from so as to not accidentally face them. When players are tethered together,Doominflicted players should line themselves up with the white puddles left at the edge of the arena, with the player of the corresponding symbol on the opposite side. When the attack fires, players must be sure to move back if nessesary to cleanse theirDoomdebuff if the attack does not push them all the way. At the same time,Charibertwill castHeavensflame, dealing heavy fire damage in an AoE around each player. This debuffs withFire Resistance Down II, so if players overlap they will die. If a player is dead when this attack goes off, a random player will be hit twice, also resulting in a death. At the same time, both gaze attacks will fire, so players must be sure to not be facing either attack before they are knocked back as they lose control for two seconds. Finally,Noudenetwill summon eightMeteor Cirlcesthat must be destroyed immediately. The meteors fall quite quickly so this acts as a sort of soft DPS check. Once all the circles have been destroyed,Thordanwill return and use anotherAncient Quagato signifiy the end of the mechanic. Heal and mitigate to handle this, and prepare for another auto attack andHeavenly Heel/Ascalon's Mightcombo. Following this,Thordanwill begin castingAetheric Burst, his enrage. He must be reduced to two percent HP before this finishes or he will wipe the party. WhenThordandropsAscalonand falls to one knee begging for mercy, players must stop attacking, for if he is killed here, the party will not be able to proceed to the final phase of the encounter. Once he moves away, the next phase will begin.Phase 6: Nidhogg and HraesvelgrBoth bosses have omnidirectional hitboxes and cannot be freely moved by players. For most of this phase, Nidhogg will be at the west arena wall and Hraesvelgr will be at the east wall.AbilitiesWyrmsclaw: High damage auto-attack used by both Dragons.Wyrmsbreath: Each non-tank player will be tethered to eitherNidhoggorHraesvelgr, who will aim a conal AoE at them, while the tanks will be struck with one of two possible kinds of tankbusters based on whether one or both Dragon's mouths are glowing. Tethers must be of a sufficient length, as indicated visually, to prevent lethal damage.Dread Wyrmsbreath:Nidhoggtethers to three random non-tank players and fires a conal AoE (Fire Breath) at them. This deals high fire damage and debuffs withFire Resistance Down IIandBoiling, which resolves into aPyreticdebuff that deals massive damage upon movement.Boilingwill not be inflicted by being hit withIce Breathat the same time and can be removed by being hit by a laterCauterizefromHraesvelgr.Great Wyrmsbreath:Hraesvelgrtethers to the other three random non-tank players and fires a conal AoE (Ice Breath) at them. This deals high ice damage and debuffs withIce Resistance Down IIandFreezing, which will resolve intoDeep Freeze, immobilizing a player for thirty seconds.Freezingwill not be inflicted by being hit withFire Breathat the same time and can be removed by being hit by a laterCauterizefromNidhogg.Staggering Breath: AoE Tankbuster. Used wheneitherDragon's mouths are glowing during their Wyrmsbreath attack. The Dragon with the glowing mouth will use a conal AoE (Dark BreathforNidhogg,Holy BreathforHraesvelgr) through the middle of the arena, while the Dragon with the non-glowing mouth will hit their target with a large circular tankbuster AoE (Staggering Breath). Anyone aside from the primary target caught in this will be knocked back and killed.Dark Orb/Holy Orb: Split tankbuster. When both Dragons' mouths are glowing, they will each fire an orb that must be split by both tanks, as each orb targets a single tank and explodes in a small AoE, inflicting damage and debuffing with eitherSustained Light DamageorSustained Dark Damage, which will both inflict massive damage over time, and can only be nullified by the other orb.Swirling Blizzard: A large telegraphed donut AoE fromHraesvelgrthat compresses the safe region for the Wyrmsbreath mechanics to be a circular area. Getting hit by this will deal lethal damage.Vows: Two conditions that must be upheld during the entirety of the phase. Failure to do so will cause one of the bosses to enrage and deal significantly more damage while taking significantly less damage, most likely resulting in a wipe.Mortal Vow:Nidhoggtargets a random DPS with a small AoE and deals light damage while applying this debuff, significantly lowering their healing potency and inflicting moderate damage over time. Any additional players hit are debuffed withSuppuration, decreasing their maximum HP by 50% and increasing their damage taken. After thirty four seconds the debuff will resolve and deal damage in a small AoE, passing the debuff to one other player within the AoE. Any additional players hit will also be debuffed withSuppuration. If the debuff is not passed to another player, it will causeNidhoggto enrage. Once the debuff is passed on, the original player who carried the debuff will be inflicted withMortal Atonement, preventing them from receiving the debuff for two minutes (effectively the remainder of the phase unless if they were the first one targeted withMortal Vow).Solemn Vow: If a player dies to any ofHraesvelgr'sattacks, he will enrage.Akh Afah: Each Dragon targets a healer with a stack AoE that deals high damage and debuffs withMagic Vulnerability Up, meaning that overlap will wipe the party. The Dragons will also tether to one another at the beginning of the cast if there is a difference of more than three percent HP, with a purple tether ifNidhogghas more HP and a white tether ifHraesvelgrhas more HP. If the Dragons are tethered by the end of the cast, the stack AoE from the higher HP boss will inflict lethal damage.Hallowed Wings: One ofHraesvelgr'swings will glow, indicating that the entire half of the arena on that side will be hit by a large AoE that deals lethal damage. This resolves at the same time asHallowed Plume.Hallowed Plume: Depending on whetherHrasevelgr'shead is raised or lowered, he will target the two farthest or closest players respectively. These players will be hit with large circular AoE tankbusters.Wroth Flames: Three sets of three orbs will spawn, the first set in the center, then one set at a corner, followed by the final set in the opposite corner. These orbs will erupt in a cross (Flame Burst) that reaches across the entire arena set by set, and inflict moderate damage andDamage Downto anyone caught in the AoE. Four random players will also be debuffed withSpreading Flames, two others will be debuffed withEntangled Flames, and the remaining two players will not receive a debuff.Spreading Flames: Four players will be inflicted with this debuff, expiring after twenty four seconds, then detonate in a small AoE that does no damage to the target player and inflictsFire Resistance Down II. However, getting caught in another player's AoE will inflict lethal damage and a moderate knockback. If the afflicted player dies with this debuff before it expires, it will detonate immediately and most likely wipe the party.Entangled Flames: Two players will be inflicted with this debuff, expiring after twenty four seconds (Entangled Pyre) and requires a stack of two total players, dealing moderate magic damage and inflictingFire Resistance Down II. If players are not stacked when the debuff expires, the debuffed player will explode, inflicting heavy raid damage (killing anyone withFire Resistance Down II) andDamage Downon everyone. If the afflicted player dies with this debuff before it expires, it will detonate immediately and most likely wipe the party.Akh Morn:Nidhoggwill target a random player for a set of four stack AoEs that deal high damage, requiring heavy mitigation, and drop persistent puddles. If players step in these, they will be debuffed with a lethalBleedthat will shortly kill them.Hot Wing/Hot Tail:Nidhoggwill fire either a line AoE through the center of the arena or the top and bottom thirds of the arena, dealing lethal damage to anyone hit.Cauterize: One or both of the Dragons will charge across their side of the arena with a breath attack, dealing high damage and inflicting eitherBurnsforNidhoggorFrostbiteforHraesvelgr, inflicting high damage over time. If players are inflicted with the opposite elemental debuff (FreezingorBoiling), the attack will deal non-lethal damage, the debuff will be removed, and the damage over time debuff will not be applied. The first player hit will take significantly more damage, requiring either a tank invulnerability or heavy mitigation to survive.Touchdown:Nidhogglands in the center of the arena andHraesvelgrlands on the south wall of the arena, dealing moderate proximity damage.Revenge of the Horde: Enrage. Both Dragons cast this. If both Dragons are not defeated before the cast finishes, the party will wipe.Resentment: Party-wide damage from the untargetableEyes of Nidhoggthat inflicts aBleeddebuff.Shockwave: Party-wide damage fromThordanthat inflicts aBleeddebuff.StrategyNidhogg will appear alongside Hraesvelgr, who will have two status effects:Neurolink, which is cosmetic and has no gameplay functionality, andSolemn Vow, which will cause him to enrage if he kills any player with an attack. When the phase begins, both Dragons will use an auto-attack, then begin casting their respective breath attacks, each tethering to three random non-tank players. Players will need to move away from the Dragon they are tethered to until the tether changes from purple to orange/white. The tanks will both move to the northern half of the arena to hold enmity. They will also be watching to see if one or both of the Dragon’s jaws glow. If one is glowing and the other isn't, the glowing mouth will fire a conal AoE through the center of the arena, while the non-glowing mouth will target their respective tank withStaggering Breath, a tankbuster. If both mouths are glowing, the tanks will need to come together to soak bothLight OrbandDark Orbto neutralize both of theSustaineddamage debuffs. At the same time, tethered players will need to stack with a player of the opposite tether to neutralize the elemental debuff received. Two sets of players can move to the south of the arena with one set moving to the north, or all three sets to the south, as long as groups are properly spaced out to avoid overlap.Following this, a random DPS will be inflicted withMortal Vowwith a small AoE. The debuff must be passed four times during the fight in roughly thirty second intervals, which occur after most major mechanics. Players need to determine who the debuff will be passed to and in what order, such as melee DPS to ranged DPS and back to melee. The debuff should never be passed to a healer because it inhibits healing output. Players need to spread whenMortal Vowis first applied, as anyone who is too close to to the target for the AoE will be inflicted withSuppuration, decreasing their maximum HP by 50% and increasing their damage taken, which is essentially a death sentence.Following this, players will split into their light parties as the Dragons begin castingAkh Afah. If the Dragons tether to each other, players need to be sure to bring them within three percent HP of each other, or this attack will wipe the party. Based on the color of the tether, players can easily tell which Dragon has the higher HP (white forHraesvelgr, purple forNidhogg). These attacks should be mitigated as they deal high damage. Players can stack directly to the north and south of the center of the arena.Once theAkh Afahresolves,Nidhoggwill leave to either the north or south edge of the arena on either the east or west side. Shortly after, he will charge across that half of the arena withCauterize, killing any who are hit. At the same time one ofHraesvelgr'swings will begin to glow, indicating a cleave on that entire side of the arena withHallowed Wings. This will leave a single quadrant of the arena as a safe zone.Hraesvelgrwill also either raise or lower his head, indicating who he will target forHallowed Plume, a tankbuster. If his head is raised, he will target the furthest two players, and if it is lowered, he will target the two closest players. Tanks will need to adjust to bait the tankbusters, and space out to avoid overlap. Once these attacks resolve, players will need to hand off theMortal Vowdebuff. It is recommended that they move to the center of the arena, while the rest of the party is away from the center, to avoid passing to the incorrect player. It is critical that that only the two players passing the debuff are next to each other with no other players nearby, as any additional player that is hit by the debuff expiration AoE will be inflicted withSuppuration.The next mechanic players will have to handle isWroth Flames/Akh Mornand the following debuffs. Three orbs will spawn in the center of the arena, followed by another set in one of the four corners, and finally in the corner opposite of that, creating a diagonal line. Players will then be debuffed withSpreading Flames,Entangled Flames, or no debuff at all. When the orbs begin exploding,Hraesvelgrwill useCauterizeacross a random side of the arena.Akh Mornswill also appear under the players, who need to remain stacked to handle these, then be ready to move out of them as they inflict a heavyBleeddebuff that will most likely kill the player inflicted. To best handleAkh Mornat the same time as the fire orbs, players should move across the edge of the safe area and cut towards the center of the arena where the first set of orbs spawned.Following the resolution of theAkh Mornsand the fire orbs, the Dragons will land back in their respective locations andNidhoggwill use eitherHot WingorHot Tailand the debuffs will resolve. Players withEntangled Flamesand their partners should stack nearNidhogg, while the other players withSpreading Flamesspread out to avoid overlap. Players will need to adjust according to eitherHot WingorHot Tail, then pass theMortal Vowdebuff for a second time.The Dragons will cast anotherAkh Afah, and can be handled the same way as before. This is the last time players will need to worry about keeping both Dragons' HP balanced for the rest of the phase. Following this,Hraesvelgrwill useHallowed WingsandHallowed Plumeon one side of the arena whileNidhogguses the oppositeHot TailorHot Wing. Players will need to adjust to handle where the tanks need to stand in order to bait the plumes while also avoiding the other AoEs.Players will then be tethered to either Dragon again, however they will need to keep their debuffs for the next mechanic. Players tethered toHraesvelgrshould spread out to the north and players tethered toNidhoggshould spread to the south, with tanks resolving their mechanics. Once the tethers resolve, both Dragons will move to the north edge of the arena and prepare aCauterize. Players will need to line up in the hitbox of the opposite Dragon they were tethered to with a tank at the front of each line, as each tank will not have a debuff to neutralize and will take full damage from the attack. To handle this, the tanks should use their invulnerability skills, with healers keeping them topped off to handle the debuff damage. If a player is debuffed withPyreticthey need to remain still until the debuff falls off.Once the debuffs are resolved, players will need to move to a corner to avoid the proximity damage fromNidhoggtouching down in the center of the arena. Immediately following this, players will need to passMortal Vowfor the final time. FollowingTouchdown, both Dragons will begin castingRevenge of the Horde, and must be defeated before the cast finishes. Once both Dragons are defeated, the untargetableEyes of Nidhoggwill appear and castResentment, dealing raid damage and inflicting bleed. IfThordanwas spared, he will reappear and absorb theEyes of Nidhoggand Hraesvelgr's, transforming intoDragon-king Thordan. During this sequence, he will useShockwaveonce, dealing raid damage and also inflicting bleed. At the end of the sequence, he will useAlternative End, dealing massive damage that must be heavily mitigated. To ensure players do not use mitigation too early, they should time their mitigation after the bleed effect from Shockwave wears off. Afterwards, the arena will transition and the final phase will begin. IfThordanwas not spared, the fight will essentially loop back to theEyes of Nidhoggphase but the party will not have access toSoul of FriendshiporSoul of Devotion, making the eyes unkillable and ensuring a wipe.Phase 7:Dragon-king ThordanNote that in this phase, the boss cannot be moved, but he will turn to face the highest enmity player if not casting an action, which is important for orienting for some mechanics.AbilitiesAlternative End: Occurs during the transition from the previous phase, dealing massive raid damage that must be mitigated.Trinity:Thordanauto-attacks three players between each mechanic as small AoEs, the first and second in the enmity list, and the closest player, inflicting various debuffs based on their order in that list.Trinityalways occurs twice between eachEdgemechanic.Highest Enmity: Inflicted with a stackingDark Resistance Down, increasing the damage from the nextTrinityof this type.Second Highest: Inflicted with a stackingLight Resistance Down, increasing the damage from the nextTrinityof this type.Closest: Inflicted with stackingLight Resistance Down,Dark Resistance DownandPhysical Vulnerability Up, making another hit fromTrinitylethal until thePhysical Vulnerability Upexpires.This requires the party to cycle through baiting the attacks to avoid deaths. The tanks should swap every two auto-attacks, and the recommended order is for two acting melee DPS to bait the closest attacks, then the acting ranged DPS, and finally the healers, before repeating the cycle. This will give enough time for the debuffs to fall off the first player who baited them.Edge Attacks:Thordanwill use various attacks mixed withIn/Outmechanics, determined by what elementThordan'sswords are infused with. If the swords are covered in ice (Ice of Ascalon), players need to move into the boss's hitbox to dodge a donut AoE, and out if the swords are covered with fire (Flames of Ascalon), to dodge a point-blank AoE.Exaflare's Edge: Three tri-directional circle AoEs spawn around the boss, and fire a series of moving circle AoEs in the direction of the arrows. Any player hit by these will die.Akh Morn's Edge:Thordanspawns three towers that need to be soaked by multiple players: two red towers should have three players each, while the blue tower should have both tanks. Each tower will hit players within multiple times dealing heavy stack damage that requires mitigation, starting at five and increasing by one with each cast (up to seven). If a tower does not have any people, it will explode and the party will wipe.Gigaflare's Edge:Thordanspawns three proximity AoEs in sequence that will explode in order, killing any player who is too close and inflicting a large amount of party-wide damage otherwise, requiring mitigation.For each of these attacks, the three AoEs/towers will spawn always relative to where the boss is facing: one behind, one northeast, and one northwest.Morn Afah's Edge: Enrage. Three yellow towers will spawn around the boss and must be soaked by one player each or the party will instantly wipe. Any player within the towers will die upon the cast finishing. The towers must continue to be soaked until all players are dead and the party is wiped or the boss is defeated.StrategyThough this phase is relatively simple in terms of its mechanics, it requires players to handle high damage output and evade reactionary mechanics. To open the phase, players must group together and heavily mitigate the damage from the stage transition, which also inflicts a heavyBleed. once the boss is targetable, players will need to handle the first set ofTrinityattacks, then the in/out mechanic forExaflare's Edge. Each cast of this ability can be handled the same way, by moving to either side of the southernExaflare, then move in to where its hitbox previously was once it fires. Following this, players will move further south to where the two diamond patterns on the floor meet to avoid the remaining flares, then move in to prepare for the next set ofTrinities.Next, players will handleAkh Morn's Edge, moving to have the correct amount/role of players in their respective towers. The in/out mechanic will take place, then the circles will fire five times. Mitigate theAkh Mornhits, and be careful not to leave the AoEs before the attack finishes, or everyone will take a massive party-wide hit. Once again, players will move to handle the incomingTrinity.ForGigaflare's Edge, players must simply identify the order and location that the proximity markers drop in, and move around the arena, never moving more than max melee range to the center of the arena. This mechanic requires mitigation and healing as well. To handle, players must move in or out of the boss's hitbox, and then be prepared to move out as soon as that portion of the attack resolves. Following this attack's resolution, players must handleTrinityagain.These mechanics will repeat three times, and then the boss will enrage, castingMorn Afah's Edge. For this attack, each tower must be soaked by one player, killing them when the cast resolves. If a player is not in each tower, the party will wipe when the cast finishes. Players will need to push hard to meet this DPS check if the boss's HP is still high. These circles will continue to spawn until either players are unable to mitigate the circles, or the boss is defeated. After the first two tower sets, the remaining two alive players should not soak the towers, and instead let them explode, as this buys an additional second to damage the boss.Reward1Dragonsong TokenDragonsong's Reprise Adventurer PlateWhen originally released, you could receive only one reward item per week for completing Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate).
