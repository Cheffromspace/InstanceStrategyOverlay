He turned to the terrible being known as the Cloud of Darkness, a ruler of the void, and asked of her strength to make the world kneel before his throne with a covenant of blood.When Xande was slain, his ambitions were laid to rest alongside him. Yet the Cloud of Darkness still seeks to enter the material realm, and will soon find passage through the Voidgate set to manifest within Syrcus Tower. With the fiend's coming, can the fellowship of NOAH brave the void and rescue the three souls able to stem the Cloud's flood of shadows, or will the expedition itself vanish beyond the rift in the World of Darkness?— In-game descriptionThe World of Darknessis a level 50raidintroduced inpatch 2.5.

This means most mechanics must still be dealt with appropriately unlike in the previous twoAlliance Raidsin theCrystal Towerseries.Angra MainyuUpdated World of Darkness GuideVideo Guide Part OneVideo Guide Part TwoDouble Vision, a floor-covering AoE that is split into red and white, which gives a stacking debuff depending on what colour you're standing on. The white AOE will give a "Sullen" debuff and the red AOE will give an "Ireful" debuff. The stacks will reset to 1 if you alternate which colour you stand on when it hits. If you get 2 stacks of the debuff you will take 2.5k damage. If you get 3 stacks you will die.When he castsMortal Gaze, anyone looking in his direction will receive aDoomdebuff that kills you in 10 seconds. Stand on whichever one of the four circular platforms that is lit up to remove this debuff. You can also turn away from the boss when he casts the ability to completely avoid the Doom debuff.Roulette, signified by a finger and a cone that rotates clockwise around the boss room, occurs when 4Final Hourglassspawn at the outer edge of the room. Kill the 4 Final Hourglass one by one. To avoid being killed, do not stand in the quarter that is lit up when the last Final Hourglass dies. As long as all four of the Hourglasses die, you will be able to run out of that section if you happen to be in it.Level 100 Flare: Red ball spawns on a player and a red circle appears on the ground. This ability tethers several players to 1 player. You need to run out of the circle to cancel the ability. Players in the red circle will all take massive damage if the total number of players in the circle is an even number.Level 150 Death: Purple ball spawns on a player and a purple circle appears on the ground. This ability tethers several players to 1 player. You need to run out of the circle to cancel the ability. Players in the purple circle will all die if the total number of players in the circle is a multiple of 3.Adds should be killed or they will deal powerful raidwide damage.Five-headed DragonIce Floor's AoE expands if it hits a player. When you see a white, circular swirl on the ground, run away.The poisonSlimesneed to be killed to stop them from joining together and casting silence on the entire raid. Killing them causes them to burst into poison resistance buffs. Wherever the slimes spawn, there will be a puddle of slime left over. At least one player needs to stand in the puddle to prevent more slimes from spawning and turning into aToxic Slime.When the boss channelsDiscordanceyou have to kill the 5 extra heads that appear or the raid will wipe. The boss could use this multiple times, so stay on your toes if your DPS is slower.The boss will occasionallymark a playerwith a stack marker. When this happens, a small number of players (usually 3-5) need to stack on this player to split the damage. If this does not happen, the player will receive 9999 damage.When you seeProminence, red circles spawn on the ground followed by red or white balls, kill the balls ASAP before they explode and deal damage.Red Bird Tetherattaches to a player and inflicts a debuff, the player needs to run and touch another player before the debuff kills them.Heatwaveis a raid-wide attack used when the boss' HP is low. For 5 seconds, every action you make will deal 500 damage.Howling Atomos (3rd Trash Pull)Everyone stacks on one side including tank. One person will get marked, they have to go to the other side and get devoured by themselves and will be spit off the platform. Then someone in the party has to stand in the light circle, and that person can jump back up. Stand right under the mob when it's casting Shockwave because if you're not in that purple puddle you will get knocked off. The knockback can be prevented withArm's LengthorSurecast.CerberusWhen Cerberus becomes unchained and startsThrashing, a group of players (usually Alliance B, plus any DPS that want to) needs to execute the following in order:Stand next to theGastric Orbmob to get hit byMinispell and shrunk to a small size.Stand in thePurple Gooto getDevouredby the boss. (Do not stand in the purple goo if you don't have theMinidebuff, as Cerberus will instantly kill you.)Once inside, kill the adds on the wall in his stomach.When the adds are dead he will stop thrashing, and will slump to the ground in pain. Groups outside the stomach need to use the two tethers to re-chain him while he is weakened - both tethers need to be re-attached to each of theOpen Fetterson his sides by interacting with them.If there are fewer than 5 living players outside the belly, Cerberus will immediately eject all players inside him without collapsing.[1]If his belly adds are not killed or he is not re-chained, Cerberus'HasteandDamage Upbuffs will stack out of control and wipe the raid. There are two meta strategies for handling this mechanic:DPS RushAll DPS should get swallowed to burn down the stomach walls as quickly as possible. One (1) healer joins them so they don't die.DPS Rush is bothfasterandsafer, as B alliance can be people who don't know how to get in the belly or are new. The ABC strat below is just included for reference and should only be used if most of the alliance insists on doing it.ABC = Adds/Belly/ChainsAlliance A should pull and kill the adds,Wolfsbane, which are quite dangerous if not tanked because their attack is a large cleave poison.Alliance B should go into Cerberus' stomach.Alliance C should tank Cerberus, and focus on re-chaining Cerberus whilst he is weakened.Due to gear creep, DPS Rush is far more common nowadays, but just make sure your alliance is all on the same page and you should have no trouble.Cerberus has aTail Swipeattack that hits players behind him in a cone.Ululationis a roar that causes players who are not around other players to become feared for 15 seconds. Stay near your party members to avoid the fear effect.Cloud of DarknessCloud of Darkness targets the tank with a powerful auto-attack that also deals damage over time, so keep your tank safe.A random player will get targeted with red crosshairs (Feint Particle Beam). After a few seconds, blasts will start chasing after the target player at running speed damaging anyone nearby. Each blast adds aVulnerability Updebuff and it kills you quickly if you stop moving. The player targeted should run towards the outside edge of the area, away from all other players.Any time she moves around the ring, she fires a massive laser (Zero-form Particle Beam) through the center of the area. When she disappears, immediately move to the sides. This attack will give aVulnerability Updebuff.Throughout the fight, she will spawncometson yellow circle markers. At least one person should stand in each one before the comet reaches the ground or the raid suffers moderate damage (several empty comets will wipe the raid). The person in the comet area will take a small hit.Mid-fight, the floor of the area will light up and cloud and storm adds will start spawning. Kill them before they get close enough for the boss to eat them, or she will wipe you if she eats enough. The clouds can be affected byHeavybut not byBind. If anyone stands between the clouds and CoD, it will add theHeavyeffect to them. After the cloud phase is done she will do a raid-wide attack.Next, she will spawn 3 clouds in a triangle formation. These clouds have a box shaped outline around them and cannot be damaged outside the box after a few seconds, so move into one of the boxes and kill the clouds. A, B, and C should have their own cloud and this should be marked ahead of time.If your raid DPS is very low, worm adds will spawn around the area before the cloud phase. Hitting them once or twice causes them to disappear. The worms add many debuffs like Morbol's Bad Breath to anyone standing too close to them. Stay away and let the ranged DPS handle.LootSee also:Demon ArmorAngra Mainyu10Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDemon Boots of AimingFeet120CBlue1Demon Caligae of ScoutingFeet120CBlue1Demon Caligae of StrikingFeet120CBlue1Demon Circlet of MaimingHead120CBlue1Demon Circlet of ScoutingHead120CBlue1Demon Circlet of StrikingHead120CBlue1Demon Greaves of MaimingFeet120CBlue1Demon Hat of AimingHead120CBlue1Demon Hat of CastingHead120CBlue1Demon Hat of HealingHead120CBlue1Demon Helm of FendingHead120CBlue1Demon Sabatons of FendingFeet120CBlue1Demon Sandals of CastingFeet120CBlue1Demon Sandals of HealingFeet120CBlue1Five-headed Dragon20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDemon Bracers of AimingHands120CBlue1Demon Bracers of ScoutingHands120CBlue1Demon Bracers of StrikingHands120CBlue1Demon Breeches of AimingLegs120CBlue1Demon Breeches of FendingLegs120CBlue1Demon Breeches of MaimingLegs120CBlue1Demon Gauntlets of FendingHands120CBlue1Demon Gauntlets of MaimingHands120CBlue1Demon Gloves of CastingHands120CBlue1Demon Gloves of HealingHands120CBlue1Demon Sarouel of ScoutingLegs120CBlue1Demon Sarouel of StrikingLegs120CBlue1Demon Skirt of CastingLegs120CBlue1Demon Skirt of HealingLegs120CBlue1Cerberus30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDemon Armor of FendingBody120CBlue1Demon Boots of AimingFeet120CBlue1Demon Caligae of ScoutingFeet120CBlue1Demon Caligae of StrikingFeet120CBlue1Demon Chestpiece of ScoutingBody120CBlue1Demon Chestpiece of StrikingBody120CBlue1Demon Greaves of MaimingFeet120CBlue1Demon Mail of MaimingBody120CBlue1Demon Robe of CastingBody120CBlue1Demon Robe of HealingBody120CBlue1Demon Sabatons of FendingFeet120CBlue1Demon Sandals of CastingFeet120CBlue1Demon Sandals of HealingFeet120CBlue1Demon Tabard of AimingBody120CBlue1Cloud of Darkness40Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsOnion Knight Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)Cloud of Darkness Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDemon Armor of FendingBody120CBlue1Demon Bracers of AimingHands120CBlue1Demon Bracers of ScoutingHands120CBlue1Demon Bracers of StrikingHands120CBlue1Demon Breeches of AimingLegs120CBlue1Demon Breeches of FendingLegs120CBlue1Demon Breeches of MaimingLegs120CBlue1Demon Chestpiece of ScoutingBody120CBlue1Demon Chestpiece of StrikingBody120CBlue1Demon Circlet of MaimingHead120CBlue1Demon Circlet of ScoutingHead120CBlue1Demon Circlet of StrikingHead120CBlue1Demon Gauntlets of FendingHands120CBlue1Demon Gauntlets of MaimingHands120CBlue1Demon Gloves of CastingHands120CBlue1Demon Gloves of HealingHands120CBlue1Demon Hat of AimingHead120CBlue1Demon Hat of CastingHead120CBlue1Demon Hat of HealingHead120CBlue1Demon Helm of FendingHead120CBlue1Demon Mail of MaimingBody120CBlue1Demon Robe of CastingBody120CBlue1Demon Robe of HealingBody120CBlue1Demon Sarouel of ScoutingLegs120CBlue1Demon Sarouel of StrikingLegs120CBlue1Demon Skirt of CastingLegs120CBlue1Demon Skirt of HealingLegs120CBlue1Demon Tabard of AimingBody120CBlue1Faded Copy of Blind to the DarkOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Faded Copy of HungerOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Puff of DarknessMinionN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantitySyrcus ShardMaterialN/AABasic1RewardsWhen originally released, players could receive only one reward item per week for completing duties in The World of Darkness.

It is enough to kill one Howling Atomos to clear the fight.ImagesGear ImagesDungeon ImagesConcept ArtRaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale↑FFXIV Mythbusters | What if Cerberus Ate EVERYONE? - Caetsu Chaiji Ch.
