Though the king is not considered a primal in the strictest sense, he poses a threat not unlike that of the beastman gods, in that his influence could corrupt his people's peaceful nature. And so, like those other aether-starved beings, he too must be felled for the sake of the realm.— In-game descriptionThornmarch (Hard)is a level 50trialintroduced inpatch 2.1. As ofpatch 6.2, extensive changes have been implemented to streamline the encounter, as this is the first mandatory 8-player duty that new players will participate in.Contents1Strategy1.1King of Moogles: Good King Moggle Mog XII1.2Phase 11.3Phase 22Loot2.1Treasure Coffer3Lore4Images5Dialogue5.1Cutscene5.2Duty DialogueStrategyKing of Moogles:Good King Moggle Mog XIIOwing to its lack of an ilvl sync, enemies' health can be downed quickly and thus not all mechanics listed below may be experienced. Initially, the Mooglesguard must be defeated before the boss, Good King Moggle Mog XII, appears. Each of the moogles has aclass/joband name to tell them apart:Whiskerwall Kupdi Koop- PaladinWoolywart Kupqu Kogi- ArcherPukla Puki the Pomburner- Black MagePukna Pako the Tailturner- RogueFurryfoot Kupli Kipp- White Mage (usesBlue MagespellPom Cure)Ruffletuft Kupta Kapa- WarriorPuksi Piko the Shaggysong- BardPhase 1Moogles will gradually pop up over time, with only Kupdi Koop present at the start. He usesSpinning Mogshield, a point-blank AoE, but has nothing else noteable. Immediately after Kupdi Koop is defeated, Kupqu Kogi and Kupta Kapa will spawn. Kupqu Kogi castsMograin of death, a damage AoE cast on every player, who should spread out to avoid overlapping, while Kupta Kapa casts1000 Kuporize Swipe, a cone frontal AoE. Once they are defeated, Puksi Riko and Kupli Kipp will appear and attack. Puksi Riko castsMoogleday Night fever, a line AoE, while Kupli Kipp castsPom Holy, a small damage AoE that may force players to begin dancing for a few seconds.The last two Mooglesguard, Pukla Puki and Pukna Pako, will then drop down into the arena. Pukla Puki castsPom Meteor, which summons 4 meteors signaled by falling Moogle heads towards red circles. Players should go into these circles to prevent the Moogle heads from hitting the ground and inflicting unavoidable damage. Meanwhile, Pukna Pako will cast a tankbuster,Moogle Thrust, so tanks should prepare with mitigation abilities. Once they are defeated, all the Mooglesguard will get up, now untargettable, and summon the boss, Good King Moogle Mog XII. The King castsMemento Moogle, inflicting hard unavoidable damage, while the Mooglesguard disappear and leave you to fight the King.Phase 2The King will be the only enemy targettable, and defeating him will the end the trial, but this phase will have many mechanics to look out for:Good King's Decree: Throughout the fight, the King will summon his Mooglesguard, still untargettable, to bombard the raid with their abilities shown in Phase 1, only much more serious.First Decree: The King first summons Pukna Pako and Kupqu Kogi, and the former castsPom Bog, creating a poison AoE in the middle of the arena. Meanwhile, the King castsMog Stone IV, a stack marker, but be prepared to spread out afterwards, as Kupqu Kogi then castsMograin of death. After that, the King castsPom Holy.Second Decree: The King next summons  Kupdi Koop, Puksi Piko, and Kupta Kapa. Aside from Puksi Piko, the King and the other two Mooglesguard begin casting massive AoEs namedMoogle-Go-Round, soon covering the entire arena in AoEs. Stay on the Moogle who begin castingMoogle-Go-Roundnext, then move to the King when he finishes casting to have a safe spot. Once the AoEs are done, Puksi Piko will castMoogleday Night feverin the safe spot, forcing players to run to safety. After that, the King castsTwin Pom Meteor, the first time players will ever see a tankbuster stack marker, meaning the tanks should stack together to survive it, and thenPom Holyonce more.Third Decree: Lastly, the King summons Kupli Kipp and Pukla Puki. After Pukla Puki castsPom Meteoragain, the King castsMog Comet, summoning circle AoEs that being chasing random players around. Once that is done, players should go inside the circles and mitigate the Moogle Heads. Kupli Kipp then castsPom Stone III, covering the ciruclar middle in a AoE, and then the edges and middle. Once the middle AoE has gone, go there to avoid the second part ofPom Stone III. The King will immedietly castMog Stone IV, followed in rapid succession byMog Creation, a Line Aoe, so players should spread out to avoid being hit once the stack is dealt with.After that, the King castsPom Holy, as well as a tankbuster,1000 Kuponze Charge. The King then repeats theGood King's Decreecycle as shown above until he is defeated.LootSee also:Mogpon Weapons12Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsGood King Moggle Mog XII Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)Moggle Mog XII's Whisker(Drops at a fixed rate.)Treasure CofferNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityMorbid MogbladeGladiator's Arm75CBlue1Malignant MogaxeMarauder's Arm75CBlue1Monstrous MogswordDark Knight's Arm75CBlue1Melancholy MogforkLancer's Arm75CBlue1Murderous MogfistsPugilist's Arm75CBlue1Maliferous MogtanaSamurai's Arm75CBlue1Mortal MogknivesRogue's Arm75CBlue1Mischievous MogbowArcher's Arm75CBlue1Menacing Mog GunMachinist's Arm75CBlue1Maleficent MogstaffTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm75CBlue1Majestic MogtomeArcanist's Grimoire75CBlue1Manipulative MogfoilRed Mage's Arm75CBlue1Mighty MogrodTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm75CBlue1Munificent MogtomeScholar's Arm75CBlue1Moonlit MoglobeAstrologian's Arm75CBlue1Mogpon Coffer (IL 75)OtherN/AABasic1LoreSee also:The Raven#The Raven 04 - Moogle Myth Made ManifestLegend holds that, in a time long forgotten, mooglekind abided in the heavens as loyal servants of the gods.However, a war of deific proportions would erupt, triggered by a feud over a single goblet of wine. Growing weary of the conflict, the reigning moogle monarch, Good King Moggle Mog XII, resolved to lead his people to the realm of mortals in secret, that they might again know a life of peace.Alas, the distance to the land below proved too great for little moogle wings. After much deliberation, it was decided that the journey must be made by rope, the longest that has ever been woven. So it was that the king grasped onto one end of this lifeline as his subjects, one after the next, half clambered, half slid their way to the Promised Land. In this manner all the moogles were able to arrive at their destination, whole of body and joyous of spirit. That is, all of them save for Good King Moggle Mog XII, who had not the means to lower himself.Mourning their lost king and touched by his sacrifice, the moogles have since abstained from naming a successor to the crown. Even now, they hold fast to the belief that their beloved monarch will one day return before them in all his might and majesty.ImagesDialogueCutsceneKupta Kapa:Kupo?!
