What they found instead was gold, but not the sort which would make them rich. Believing the substance precious aurum, miners unknowingly stumbled into deep pools of glowing venom thereafter known as goldbile. Not only did the liquid burn their skin, but the noisome fumes given off by the foul ooze cooked their lungs when inhaled, bringing on a quick, yet excruciating death. These truths, however, have done little to prevent new miners from braving the suffocating shafts, now even more driven to find what those who entered before could not.— In-game descriptionThe Aurum Valeis a level 47dungeonintroduced inpatch 2.0.Contents1Objectives2Enemies3Bosses3.1Locksmith3.1.1Abilities3.1.2Tank Mechanics3.2Coincounter3.2.1Abilities3.3Miser's Mistress3.3.1Adds3.3.2Abilities4Loot4.1Locksmith4.2Coincounter4.3Miser's Mistress4.4Treasure Coffers4.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 10.3 Y: 8.6)4.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 8.9 Y: 9.0)4.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 7.0 Y: 7.0)4.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 4.5 Y: 8.9)5Achievements6Images7Lore7.1Drowning In Gold7.2The Coincounter7.3The Miser's MistressObjectivesBreachthe Lock.Defeat the morbol bed keeper.Clear theCoincounter's Chest.Defeat themorbol bed keepers.EnemiesNameDropsCoincounterGlowerEftstoolGoldvineLily of the ValeLocksmithMiser's MistressBad BreathNameDropsNether NixPoisoned PeasantVale BanemiteVale BatVale DiremiteVale WaspThe first room of enemies can be problematic for inexperienced parties. There are several patrolling enemies that can quickly overwhelm the party if too many are engaged. TheNether Nixesin particular will useSticky Tongueto yank the first person it sees to its location, aggroing many enemies along the way. The party should "hug" the left wall and fight as few enemies as possible until they reach the first boss room.BossesThe Aurum Vale GuideNote that the yellow liquid does damage-over-time to players standing in them, represented by theGoldbiledebuff.LocksmithLocksmith is the first boss of The Aurum Vale - this giganticOchuhas several high damage mechanics that will test the capabilities of the parties' healers.Morbol Fruit will grow along the sides of the arena. Locksmith will cast aGold Lung debuff on the party that cannot be cleansed byEsuna. To remove the debuff, players will need to click on the Morbol Fruit to interact with the item and remove the debuff. Players should avoid having more than 2 stacks of Gold Lung, as it will increase damage taken.After interacting with a fruit, it will disappear. The Morbol Fruits respawn over time.AbilitiesHundred Lashingsis a melee attack that deals moderate to high amount of damage.Gold Rushis an instant ability that places a damage over time debuff namedGold Lung on all players. This effect stacks. The debuff can be removed by consuming a Morbol Fruit.Gold Dustis a circular AoE spell that appears under a random player. It deals moderate damage to all players hit.Tank MechanicsIn order to click on the Morbol Fruit to remove the debuff stacks, tanks may have to stun Locksmith to avoid being interrupted.CoincounterCoincounter is a giant cyclops that has powerful front AoE attacks, swipe cleave abilities, and a room-wide AoE lightning mechanic.As ofPatch 5.3orange ground indicators have been added to all of the boss' AoEs. However, there are later occurrences of this same type of boss that remain un-telegraphed, so learning the visual tells is still useful and encouraged.All non-tank players should stay away from the front of the boss at all times- Coincounter has 2 types of 100-Tonze Swipe cleaves:The first type can be identified when he holds his mace with only 1 of his hands. This is a frontal cone AoE attack.The second type can be identified when he holds his mace with 2 of his hands. This is a circular AoE attack that does an enormous amount of damage to all targets around him.100-Tonze swipe attack can bestunnedorinterrupted.At about halfHP, Coincounter will start using Eye of the Beholder, a long range, frontal cone, AoE spell. Ranged damage dealers and healers should spread apart and avoid hisGlowerand Eye of the Beholder abilities if possible.Abilities10-Tonze Swipeis an instant frontal AoE attack that does moderate amount of damage.100-Tonze Swipe(1 Hand) is a frontal cone AoE attack that does a large amount of damage to all targets hit.100-Tonze Swing(2 Hand) is a circular AoE attack that does extremely large amount of damage to all targets close to the Cyclops.Gloweris a laser fired from the eye of Coincounter onto a random player.

This C-shaped attack has safe spots behind the boss and close in.100-Tonze Swipe, 100-Tonze Swing and Eye of the Beholder can be interrupted withstuns.Miser's MistressMiser's Mistress is the final boss of The Aurum Vale. ThisMorbolboss has powerful frontal AoE attacks and should be faced away from all non-tank players. The debuffs fromBad Breathcould be deadly.Similar to Locksmith, there are objects named Morbol Fruit around the boss room. Players can consume the fruit to remove all the stacks of the debuffBurrs, which deals increasing damage over time with each additional stack. Players should consume the fruit at 2-3 Burrs stacks, and will typically need to alternate between two separate fruits to achieve this (there are 8 total fruit spawns in the room).  Note that the fruits can also remove the debuffs from Bad Breath, so if a player gets hit by this attack, they should quickly use a fruit to avoid the debilitating and possibly deadly effects of the slew of debuffs it inflicts.AddsAt halfHP, Miser's Mistress will spawn 5 strange Morbol Fruits thatmustbe destroyed immediately. Use a physical ranged or caster limit break if needed. Any fruits that hatch will turn into Morbol Seedlings that will add Burr debuff stacks with every attack. If any seedlings hatch, this could easily wipe the group.AbilitiesBad Breathis a frontal cone AoE spell that inflicts the debuffsParalysis,Silence,Poison,Blind,Slow,Heavy, andHP Penalty to all targets hit.If the healer gets hit byBad Breath, it can very quickly lead to a wipe. Healers and ranged DPS should stay far away from the boss.Esunacan be used to remove theBad Breathdebuffs, but this will only remove one status effect at a time, and if the healer is the one that was hit, the Silence effect will prevent using Esuna anyway. Players should use the Morbol Fruit to remove all the effects at once if they are hit withBad Breath.Vine Probeis a frontal column AoE attack that deals a moderate amount of damage to all targets hit.Hooked Burrsis an ability that deals a small amount of damage and adds one stack ofBurrs on a random player.Burr Burrowis an ability that inflicts the player with the debuffBurrs and deals small amount of damage per stack of Burrs already on the player. If a player has enough Burr stacks, this can do a considerable amount of damage. Use the Morbol Fruit that grow on the outside of the arena to cleanse the debuff stacks, as it cannot be cleansed with Esuna.LootSee also:Aurum Weapons,Aurum ArmorandAurum AccessoriesLocksmithNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAetherial Amber EarringsEarrings49DAetherial1Aetherial Amber RingRing49DAetherial1Aetherial Black Pearl RingRing49DAetherial1Aetherial Rubellite EarringsEarrings49DAetherial1Aetherial Rubellite RingRing49DAetherial1Aetherial Spinel EarringsEarrings49DAetherial1Aetherial Spinel RingRing49DAetherial1Aetherial Tortoiseshell ArmillaeBracelets49DAetherial1Aetherial Tourmaline EarringsEarrings49DAetherial1Aetherial Tourmaline RingRing49DAetherial1Aetherial Turquoise EarringsEarrings49DAetherial1Aetherial Turquoise RingRing49DAetherial1Aetherial Zircon EarringsEarrings49DAetherial1Aetherial Zircon RingRing49DAetherial1Aurum ArmguardsHands49BGreen1Aurum CelataHead49BGreen1Aurum Dress GlovesHands49BGreen1Aurum GauntletsHands49BGreen1Aurum Pot HelmHead49BGreen1Aurum Temple ChainHead49BGreen1CoincounterNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAurum BraisLegs49BGreen1Aurum ChasubleBody49BGreen1Aurum CuirassBody49BGreen1Aurum JacketBody49BGreen1Aurum SmallsLegs49BGreen1Aurum TrousersLegs49BGreen1Miser's MistressMorbol Card(Drops at a fixed rate)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAstaroth CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm49BGreen1Aurum BootsFeet49BGreen1Aurum Leg GuardsFeet49BGreen1Aurum SabatonsFeet49BGreen1BalisardeDark Knight's Arm49BGreen1Bloody MurderMachinist's Arm49BGreen1Canopus BillMarauder's Arm49BGreen1Canopus GuisarmeLancer's Arm49BGreen1Canopus StilettosRogue's Arm49BGreen1Miser's Folly Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Paladin's Templar Arms (Lv. 47)OtherN/ABGreen1Pupil's Book of MythrilArcanist's Grimoire49BGreen1VegaAstrologian's Arm49BGreen1Verdant HoraPugilist's Arm49BGreen1Verdant ScepterOne-handed Thaumaturge's Arm49BGreen1Verdant ShortbowArcher's Arm49BGreen1Warlock's BucklerShield49BGreen1Treasure CoffersTreasure Coffer 1 (X: 10.3 Y: 8.6)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAurum SabatonsFeet49BGreen1Aurum Leg GuardsFeet49BGreen1Aurum BootsFeet49BGreen1Morbol SeedlingMinionN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 8.9 Y: 9.0)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAurum CelataHead49BGreen1Aurum Pot HelmHead49BGreen1Aurum Temple ChainHead49BGreen1Aurum GauntletsHands49BGreen1Aurum ArmguardsHands49BGreen1Aurum Dress GlovesHands49BGreen1Mossy HornMaterialN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 7.0 Y: 7.0)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAurum CuirassBody49BGreen1Aurum JacketBody49BGreen1Aurum ChasubleBody49BGreen1Aurum TrousersLegs49BGreen1Aurum BraisLegs49BGreen1Aurum SmallsLegs49BGreen1Dodore WingMaterialN/AABasic1-2Carnivorous SeedlingMaterialN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 4.5 Y: 8.9)NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPaladin's Templar Arms (Lv. 47)OtherN/ABGreen1Canopus BillMarauder's Arm49BGreen1BalisardeDark Knight's Arm49BGreen1Canopus GuisarmeLancer's Arm49BGreen1Verdant HoraPugilist's Arm49BGreen1Canopus StilettosRogue's Arm49BGreen1Verdant ShortbowArcher's Arm49BGreen1Bloody MurderMachinist's Arm49BGreen1Verdant ScepterOne-handed Thaumaturge's Arm49BGreen1Pupil's Book of MythrilArcanist's Grimoire49BGreen1Astaroth CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm49BGreen1VegaAstrologian's Arm49BGreen1Warlock's BucklerShield49BGreen1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the following achievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Aurum Vale10Discover every location withinthe Aurum Vale.-2.0ImagesMapLoreSee also:The Harbor Herald#The Harbor Herald 06 - Garleans in the ValeDrowning In GoldOne of the many caverns found in the Coerthas central highlands, known for its glowing pools that give off a golden mist. Though beautiful to behold, the liquid is in fact a lethal seepage called goldbile—the product of a union between sulphur and mythril ore, quickened in groundwater. Drawn, by the mesmerizing scenery or the promise of precious aurum, many have unwittingly stumbled into these pools only to have the liquid burn their skin and the noisome fumes cook their lungs. As if such a place were not sufficiently perilous, prolonged exposure to the fumes wrought an adverse change to the wildlife within, rendering it too dangerous to be left unchecked. Thus did the Holy See of Ishgard petition the three allied city-states to undertake a purge of the Vale in return for the supply of bat- tle-trained chocobos, and the Grand Companies each dispatch a unit of adventurers to see to the task.The CoincounterMaking its lair in the Aurum Vale, this hulking cyclops attacks all who enter its territory, giving the impression of a watchdog jealously guard ing a golden hoard. For its antics, adventurers have named it the Coincounter.The Miser's MistressIf the miser is avaricious, then his mistress is avarice itself. Lording over all in the Aurum Vale, this enormous morbol uses its ever-searching tendrils to seize prey in a rapacious embrace before devouring it whole. While the species is known for spewing forth virulent gas, that which is produced by this specimen is surpassingly potent, an effect of its toxic environment.Pleasing to behold but excruciating to breathe within, what could otherwise be a scenic wonder to attract visitors is marred by the presence of noisome fumes. The peculiar ore known as vale bubo, born of the mingling between mythril and sulphur, is a subject of interest for geological enthusiasts.DungeonsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 15-50)Sastasha(Hard) •The Tam-Tara Deepcroft(Hard) •Copperbell Mines(Hard) •Halatali(Hard) •The Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak•Haukke Manor(Hard) •Brayflox's Longstop(Hard) •The Sunken Temple of Qarn(Hard) •Cutter's Cry•The Stone Vigil(Hard) •Dzemael Darkhold•The Aurum Vale•Castrum Meridianum•The Praetorium•Amdapor Keep(Hard) •The Wanderer's Palace(Hard) •Pharos Sirius•The Lost City of Amdapor•Hullbreaker Isle•Snowcloak•The Keeper of the LakeHeavensward(Lv. 51-60)The Dusk Vigil•Sohm Al(Hard) •The Aery•The Vault•The Great Gubal Library(Hard) •The Aetherochemical Research Facility•Neverreap•The Fractal Continuum•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum•Pharos Sirius (Hard)•The Antitower•The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)•Sohr Khai•Hullbreaker Isle (Hard)•Xelphatol•Baelsar's WallDeep Dungeon:Palace of the DeadStormblood(Lv. 61-70)The Sirensong Sea•Shisui of the Violet Tides•Bardam's Mettle•Doma Castle•Castrum Abania•Ala Mhigo•Kugane Castle•The Temple of the Fist•The Drowned City of Skalla•Hells' Lid•The Fractal Continuum (Hard)•The Swallow's Compass•Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)•The Burn•The Ghimlyt DarkDeep Dungeon:Heaven-on-HighShadowbringers(Lv. 71-80)Holminster Switch•Dohn Mheg•The Qitana Ravel•Malikah's Well•Mt.
