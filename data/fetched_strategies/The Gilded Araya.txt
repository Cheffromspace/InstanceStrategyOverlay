But it is not wonder that fills your heart when you spy the ominous devices lining the side of the structure─devices you remember seeing inside the Tower of Babil.Your sense of dread is justified when the summoning begins. Drawing upon the devotion of the imprisoned faithful, the corrupted incarnation of a Manusya is brought into being. She is Asura, a deity of battle and conflict, and whether you wish it or not, your mettle will be tested!— In-game descriptionThe Gilded Arayais a level 90trialintroduced inpatch 6.55withEndwalker.Contents1Guide1.1False Manusya: Asura2Loot3Images4Dialogue5TriviaGuideFalse Manusya:AsuraLower Realm: Raidwide damage and spawns a lethal AoE at the edge of the arena.Asuri Chakra: Spawns a point-blank AoE and multiple concentric ring AoE telegraphs, leaving narrow safe spots in between them.
