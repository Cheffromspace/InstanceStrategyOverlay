Aenc Thon will leap to the targeted area and follow up withLandsblood.Landsblood: Constant party-wide damage every few seconds, combined with several blue water AoE markers appearing around the arena. The more opaque the markers become, the closer they are to "exploding", dealing moderate damage andStunningplayers caught in the area of effect.GriauleSwinge: 60 degree frontal AoE coneFodder: Griaule will move to the center of the arena and summon five untargetablePainted Saplingadds that will then tether to him. These tethers can and should be intercepted by players, and after a short time, the adds will bestow a theGrowingbuff to whomever they were tethered to.TheGrowingbuff increases damage dealt and reduces damage taken, along with physically increasing the target's size.

A single, narrow and winding path is the only way across the pit. Players that fall into the pit are teleported back to the start, but are otherwise unharmed. Players' mobility and teleporation skills cannot be used to bypass the maze. At the same time, Aenc Thon will become surrounded in a barrier, summon theLiar's Lyre, and the two will begin castingFinale.If running the dungeon with the Trust system, each of theScionswill react differently to this:ThancredandUriangerwill bypass the maze entirely usingRough DivideandAetherial Manipulationrespectively.AlisaieandCrystal ExarchuseSprintto run the whole thing without stopping.Y'shtolawill also useSprint, but to increase her walking speed, rather than running full-tilt.MinfiliaandAlphinaudwill cautiously and slowly walk.

Once Finale has finished either by being cast or being interrupted, the arena will return to normal.Changeling's Fantasia: Aenc Thon transforms into theShade of Fear.
