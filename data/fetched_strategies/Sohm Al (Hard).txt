Bereft of its dreaded leader, the Horde scattered to the four winds, leaving the dragons' sacred grounds untended and unguarded. All manner of beastly intruders now skitter within, irresistibly drawn by the energies of bountiful crystal lodes. And the molten heart at the mountain's core beats with feverish intensity, as if seeking to expel some nesting parasite. Answer Vidofnir's plea! Cleanse the stone halls of their infestations, and return Sohm Al to its former tranquility.— In-game descriptionSohm Al (Hard)is a level 60dungeonintroduced inpatch 3.5withHeavensward.Contents1Objectives2Bosses2.1The Leightonward2.2Gowrow2.3Lava Scorpion3Loot3.1The Leightonward3.2Gowrow3.3Lava Scorpion3.4Additional Treasure Coffers3.4.1Treasure Coffer 1 (X: 11.7 Y: 12.2)3.4.2Treasure Coffer 2 (X: 12.8 Y: 10.9)3.4.3Treasure Coffer 3 (X: 10.1 Y: 12.0)3.4.4Treasure Coffer 4 (X: 8.8 Y: 11.2)4Achievements5Images5.1Gear Images5.2Dungeon ImagesObjectivesArrive at the Wound. 0/1DefeatThe Leightonward. 0/1Arrive in the Fever. 0/1DefeatGowrow. 0/1Clear the Heart. 0/1Defeat thelava scorpion. 0/1BossesSohm Al (Hard) Dungeon GuideThe LeightonwardWild HornMini TB.Inflamable FumesRaidwide.Spore SacSpawns many untargetable small spore sacs, which each explode in an AoE after a while.After the first cast, each successive cast spawns an additional (bigger) spore sac, which instead explodes in a proximity AoE. i.e. the second cast has 1 spore sac, the third cast has 2 spore sacs etc.ExcretionDamages a target.
