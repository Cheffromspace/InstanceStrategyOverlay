As the battle progresses, this ability will be accompanied by a large number of circular ground AoE.Rapid Severis a tank buster; use cooldowns as necessary to mitigate the damage.Minotaur11-tonze swipeis forward-facing melee cleave. This ability does not have an AoE ground indicator.111-tonze swingis 360-degree melee cleave & knockback. Deals extremely heavy damage. This ability does not have an AoE ground indicator.Disorienting Groandeals mild AoE damage and knockback. The boss will then rush from player to players dealing moderate damage with each impact. Afterward, he will use10-tonze slash, a forward-facing line AoE.1111-tonze Swipeis a room-wide AoE. When the boss begins charging this ability, one player (usually healer or ranged) needs to click on one of the severalBiomass Incubatortubes that encircle the arena. This will spawn an add, distracting the boss and interrupting his attack. The add needs to be killed immediately.The CuratorClockwork Alarumadds will periodically spawn occasionally along the edge of the arena; each will occupy a single square, infusing it with a debuff that damages any player who touches it. These adds slowly walk forward, spreading the debuff to additional squares, and should be killed immediately.The Curator will occasionally afflict a random player with a heavy DoT debuff calledAetherochemical Explosive. The afflicted player needs to be cleansed by the healer immediately.The Educatorwill light up a pattern of floor tiles. The tiles will explode after a short time, dealing heavy damage to any players who happen to be standing on them.Mines will occasionally spawn on random floor tiles. Avoid/ignore these until they explode.Tanks, be ready to soak heavy magic damage while gearing. This boss is best tanked in a corner, facing away from the group. Be sure to relocate in case of mines so your melee DPS don't have to dodge them, and so that you won't run into them to avoid The Educator.In summary:Kill Clockwork Alarum ASAP.Stay off lighted squares.Avoid mines.Cleanse Aetherochemical Explosive.LootSee also:Baldur Weapons,Valerian ArmorandValerian AccessoriesPhantom Ray4Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityValerian

constructs.Exhibit IV: The MirrorknightA second-generation construct boasting the strength of a bear and the acute vision of an owl. As with many early efforts with synthesis, lack of intelligence and a proclivity for violence limited its practical use.Exhibit VII: The ShabtiA fourth-generation construct, and one of the first to effectively employ cloning technology. With high intelligence and regenerative capacity, its development was hailed as a major breakthrough.Exhibit VIII: The NagaAmong the first successful efforts in synthesizing a voidsent, Void research remains an emerging field, with future developments holding great promise.Exhibit IX: The IksalionA highly intelligent construct employed by Allagan engineers to perform maintenance tasks.

Moored at Azys Lla and incorporating satellite isles, it houses over a thousand years' worth of technological marvels born of Allagan ingenuity. Its distinctive design was no accident, deemed ideal for the purpose of impressing the greatness of the Empire upon loyal citizens in all corners of the realm.Visitors to the museum can learn about notable inventions in various spheres, from modern conveniences that improved lives to military contraptions that ended them. A veritable army of automachina is on display, as is a menagerie of live chimerical specimens—some of which have reportedly escaped containment to roam free and breed.The CuratorAn autonomous machine housed within the Fractal Continuum. Primarily a tool for education, the Curator is equipped with a reality augmentation system that combines projected images and clever contrivances, allowing museum visitors to experience a plethora of technological marvels. So convincing is the effect, some have sworn that it surpasses that which it imitates.Truth Beyond The CloudsAmong every race, there are those who do not conform to societal norms—eccentrics and outcasts who hold to their own ways. The Ixal are no exception, as can be seen in the Ehcatl Nine, the gathering, of artisans and engineers who dreamed of finding Ayatlan, the legendary lost paradise of their kind. In pursuit of this dream, they labored to create an airship that could fly higher than any ever had in Eorzea, drawing upon not only their own techniques, but those of men besides—a marked departure from the majority of their brethren, who wage war with the Gridanians in the name of their goddess, Garuda. At length, the Ehcatl Nine succeeded in building a prototype vessel that could bear them higher than the clouds. But beyond there awaited a damning truth. On a solo flight, the Ixal Kezul Itzcan discovered the floating continent of Azys Lla, whereupon he ventured into the Fractal Con-tinuum to come face-to-face with a chimerical being named Iksalion. In that instant, he knew: the Ixal were created by the Allagans. Yet this revelation did naught to deter his leader, Sezul Totoloc, who declared that their dream—their burning, desire to take to the skies—is their own, and no creation of science. Thus did they resume their efforts, their eyes turned ever forward and upward, towards paradise.The Ultima BeastThis prototype primal countermeasure was created as part of the Ultima Project. A bioweapon of flesh and blood brought to life via chimerical science, it boasts remarkable vigor and advanced arcane abilities. By merging its traits with those of Ultima Warrior, an early bipedal prototype, the Allagans went on to conceive Proto Ultima.DialogueRepository Node:Warning!
