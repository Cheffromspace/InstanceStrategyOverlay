Here is the cleaned up text for the Memoria Misera (Extreme) strategy guide:

Memoria Misera (Extreme) is a level 80 trial introduced in patch 5.25 with Shadowbringers. There is no story-mode version of this duty. The encounter during The Bozja Incident is a solo instance. 

Requirements
After completing The Bozja Incident, speak to the Wandering Dramaturge in Gangos (X:6.8, Y:5.2) as a level 80 Disciple of War or Magic.

Strategy
Your battle against Varis yae Galvus takes place within a square-shaped arena with a noticeable greyish-white hue around the outer edges. Should any player touch these glowing walls for any reason, they will suffer various detrimental effects via Confines Of Memory. Throughout the encounter, players will also need to pay attention to the duty gauge (Charge) which will appear when Varis casts specific Gunshield abilities. However, Gunshield abilities will not be executed until the gauge has been fully charged.

Phase 1: Abilities
- Altius - inflicts unavoidable raid-wide damage and causes all players to leave an x-shaped marker at their current locations. 
- Terminus Est - causes all x-shaped markers to shoot large straight-line AoE's across the arena in the direction the markers are facing. 
- Alea Iacta Est - causes Varis to unleash four consecutive 180-degree cone attacks in the direction he is facing, followed by one final delayed attack directly behind himself. 
- Citius - a large, shareable, forward-cleaving tank-buster against Varis' main target.
- Ignis Est - causes Varis to turn towards a random non-tank player and aim a short-ranged telegraph in their direction. After a brief delay, Varis will shoot a large straight-line AoE in the direction of the telegraph whilst simultaneously unleashing a moderate point-blank AoE at his current location. 
- Festina Lente - places a stack-marker on both healers that will need to be shared, preferably by splitting the raid into even halves.
- Ventus Est - practically identical to Ignis Est, except Varis will utilize a donut AoE instead of a point-blank AoE.
- Vivere Militare Est - begins a small cutscene of Varis leaping out of the arena and shooting two x-shaped pulses from his gunblade towards the raid. Each tank will need to click on one of two markers near the centre of the arena to 'catch' a pulse each, locking them within an active time manoeuvre. 

Phase 2: Abilities
Varis returns to the platform and begins to cycle between three Gunshield mini-phases in random order. Each mini-phase is comprised of various previously used mechanics in combination.

Phase 3: Abilities
After destroying the Magitek Shield, Varis will leap to the centre of the arena and immediately cast Loaded Gunshield, which will not detonate until the duty gauge (Charge) has reached maximum. Once cast, the final phase of the battle begins with another rotation of mini-phases.

Mechanical Timeline
The guide then provides a detailed mechanical timeline of the abilities used in each phase.

Loot
Each player will receive 2 High Legatus Idol per kill. Collect 3-5 totems to exchange for i480 Idealized Armor coffers.

Achievements
This duty is associated with the achievement "Misshapen Memory" for defeating the specter of Varis yae Galvus.
