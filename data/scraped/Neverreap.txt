Here is the cleaned up text for the Neverreap dungeon guide:

Neverreap is a level 60 dungeon introduced in patch 3.0 with Heavensward. 

Objectives:
Arrive at the God who Whispers: 0/1
Arrive at the Wind that Summons: 0/1 
Arrive at the Cloud that Laughs: 0/1

Bosses:

Nunyenunc
- Avoid Feather Squall AoE.
- Boss will disappear and area will be covered in mist, players must run around the edge to find Nunyenunc's Shadow and kill it.
- Kill Nunyeninc's Feathers ASAP, they will explode dealing damage and inflict Vulnerability Up.

Canu Vanu  
- Morrowcloud targets random player and inflicts Bleed, healer needs to cleanse this.
- Sacred Totem marks players, they will drop a totem in their place, a few seconds later, he will cast Totem Chant, a big purple circle will spawn in a random place, any Totems need to be carried out of this circle before the cast finishes. This is easier to manage if players try to spread out when marked, keeping previously spawned totems in mind.
- If a totem is inside the circle when the cast is finished, it will turn into a Canu Vanu's Totem and make the boss immune, kill it. 
- The Chant has no other effects, its perfectly safe to stand in the target circle.

Waukkeon
- Marks a random player, they will spawn an add called Divine Mist, ignore it for now. 
- Several Divine Gale will spawn and boss will start rushing around the area dealing damage to anyone in its path. Kill the Mists then the Gales.
- When all adds are dead, boss will cast Turbine, a party-wide AoE and knockback. Everyone needs to stack next to the boss with the largest area behind them to avoid being knocked off the platform (i.e. If boss is on the west side, they should get knocked back east.)
- Tornadoes will also spawn and roam around dealing damage and knocking anyone into the air that touches them.
- Use Limit Break 2 as soon as possible due to Tornadoes.

Loot drops from bosses and additional treasure coffers.

Lore:
The sacred isles of the Vanu Vanu are hallowed as the birthplace of Bismarck. The Vundu tribe has profaned the area, led by the shaman Canu Vanu. The Waukkeon, a giant sanuwa, nests on Neverreap and its scales are prized for making the masks that symbolize power among the Vanu.
