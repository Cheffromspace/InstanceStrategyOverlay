Here is the cleaned up strategy guide for The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate):

Strategy

Phase 1: Twintania

Abilities:
- Plummet: Frontal tankbuster cleave dealing heavy damage.
- Fireball: A player is marked and the boss fires a large fireball dealing heavy magic damage. Can be split to mitigate damage.
- Twister: Four random players will have small tornadoes dropped under them. Touching these causes instant death and heavy knockback. 
- Death Sentence: Heavy tankbuster that debuffs with Slashing Resistance Down. Requires a tank swap.
- Liquid Hell: A random player is targeted with fireball spits, each dealing moderate damage and dropping persistent fire puddles that inflict Burns.
- Neurolink: The boss drops small black puddles. Standing in them decreases damage dealt by 90% but allows surviving Hatch orb explosions.
- Generate: A random DPS is marked and a black orb moves towards them. If the player is in a Neurolink, the orb explodes dealing minimal damage and inflicting Mana Hypersensitivity. Anyone else hit dies. 
- Aetheric Profusion: Enrage that wipes the party if the boss is not defeated in time.

Strategy:
- Pre-place markers for Neurolink puddles. Assign a ranged DPS to bait Liquid Hells around the edge. 
- Dodge Twister AoEs, group for Fireball, and tankswap Death Sentence. 
- Move boss away from Neurolink. Baiter drops Liquid Hells at edge.
- Marked DPS enters Neurolink for Generate orb, everyone else moves out.
- Repeat mechanics, using Neurolinks to survive orbs and Twisters. Defeat before enrage.

Phase 2: Nael deus Darnus

Abilities: 
- Heavensfall: Raid-wide proximity damage and knockback that spawns a pillar. Thermionic Burst fires conal AoEs from the pillar.
- Bahamut's Claw: Heavy 5-hit tankbuster.
- Meteor Stream: Hits 4 random players then the remaining 4. Splash damage requires spreading.
- Lunar Dynamo: Large donut AoE. Safe under boss or far away.
- Iron Chariot: Lethal point-blank AoE with knockback. 
- Dalamud Dive: Leaps on tank dealing heavy damage with splash. 
- Raven's Dive: Leaps on random player dealing small AoE damage. Others hit are knocked into wall and killed.
- Thermionic Beam: Laser on random player dealing massive damage that needs splitting.
- Hypernova: Puddle on random player inflicting lethal Bleed if lingered in.

Strategy:
- Avoid Heavensfall pillars and conal Bursts. Spread for Meteor Streams. 
- Move to avoid Lunar Dynamo, Iron Chariot, Dalamud Dive splash, and Raven's Dive. 
- Stack for Thermionic Beam. Dodge Hypernova puddles.
- Handle dragon debuff mechanics and dispel Doom with Wings of Salvation circles.
