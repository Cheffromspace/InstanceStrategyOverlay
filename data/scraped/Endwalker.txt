Here is the cleaned up text for the Endwalker expansion article:

Endwalker (considered version 6.0 of the game) is the fourth expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, after Shadowbringers. It was released on December 7th, 2021 with early access started on December 3rd.

Story:
Endwalker brings the tale of Hydaelyn and Zodiark to a conclusion eons in the making. To unravel its mysteries and conquer its challenges will be no common feat. May these records of key figures, looming adversaries, and lands yet untraveled serve you well.

Yet shadowed by their triumph in the First, the Warrior of Light and Scions of the Seventh Dawn are home at last. An even greater calamity than refulgent oblivion has been building in their absence, however─a second advent of the Final Days. Should all despair, the myriad conflicts that now ravage the land cannot but foretoken an end to life in the Source.

Our tale─of a star, and of its souls─will see the Warrior of Light sail north to Sharlayan and east to Thavnair, forge a path to the heart of the Garlean Empire, and ascend to the heavens to set foot upon the very moon itself. FINAL FANTASY XIV's first grand saga approaches its highly anticipated conclusion!

Trivia:
This expansion and its patches lean heavily into Greek mythology and Final Fantasy IV references. Greek mythology is featured heavily in the Main Scenario Quests, Pandæmonium, and Myths of the Realm raids. FFIV references are featured in some patch 6.0 dungeons (The Tower of Zot and The Tower of Babil) and the Loporrit tribe (a reference to Hummingways). They are especially prominent in the post-6.0 Main Scenario Quests, featuring several antagonists originally from FFIV. Much of the expansion's soundtrack also contain remasters of songs originally from FFIV.

The expansion's logo depicts a spaceship approaching the Moon. However, this logo is somewhat misleading:
- In the game, players access Mare Lamentorum through an Allagan teleportation portal located in the Nethergate on top of the Tower of Babil in Garlemald. 
- The spaceship in the Main Scenario Quests, the Ragnarok, is use to transport the party to Ultima Thule at the edge of the universe instead.
- The Ragnarok has a somewhat different design from the spaceship in the logo.
- The original purpose of the Ragnarok was to evacuate the people on the Source to the Moon during the Final Days, due to the limited throughput of teleporters. The Moon itself is a large spaceship constructed by Hydaelyn intended to find a new planet to repopulate. It is possible the logo may be a depiction of this original purpose.
