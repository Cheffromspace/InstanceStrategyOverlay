Here is the cleaned up text for the Amdapor Keep (Hard) dungeon guide:

Amdapor Keep (Hard) is a level 50 dungeon introduced in patch 2.5.

Objectives:
Defeat Anchag
Defeat the Boogyman  
Defeat Ferdiad

Bosses:

Anchag
The key is the four statues in the room. When you get a red marker, run behind a statue immediately to avoid massive damage and a debuff. Tank Anchag in the middle, away from the statues. Avoid his rush attack near the statues.

Boogyman  
Kill the Luminescence orb and grab the Irradiance buff to reveal the invisible Boogyman. Kill adds called Bloodmoon Sacrifice that spawn. When low on HP, Boogyman splits into two invisible forms that need to be revealed separately.

Ferdiad
Tank Ferdiad at the edge. Kill adds, especially Wicked Jester tethered to Ferdiad, to stop his growing circular AoE attack. Free players trapped in slime adds. Avoid blue spinning scythes and crisscrossing AoEs. In the final phase, he combines slime traps and a tethered add - prioritize killing the tethered add unless your DPS are trapped.

Loot includes Allagan Tomestones of Poetics, gear ranging from item level 90-100, and Demon Wall and Ferdiad Cards.
