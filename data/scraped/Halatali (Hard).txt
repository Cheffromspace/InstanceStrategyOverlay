Here is the cleaned up text for the Halatali (Hard) strategy guide:

Halatali (Hard) is a level 50 dungeon introduced in patch 2.2.

Objectives:
Defeat the mammets: 0/4
Defeat Pyracmon: 0/1  
Defeat the caged beasts: 0/7
Defeat the catoblepas: 0/1
Defeat the gladiators: 0/3
Complete the final test: 0/1

Bosses:

Pyracmon
The fight is similar to The Aurum Vale's Coincounter, with all basic Cyclops abilities. Avoid his lasers from Eye of the Beholder. A mechanical Mammet will march around with a tether to a lever. Interact with the lever when Pyracmon starts 1000 Tonze Swing to get the Manawall buff to negate the attack.

Catoblepas 
Four pedestals around the room have Tainted Eye levers. Assign one to each party member. When Catoblepas casts Demonic Eye, activate the lever for the Gloam buff to prevent damage. The boss will make his eye targetable - this is a DPS check before he stacks damage debuffs. Watch for large cone AOEs.

Silent Moss the Solemn, Franz the Fair, Langloisiert the Lionheart, and U'linbho the Sand Devil
Fight four combatants using level 50 job abilities. Kill the healer first, then the bard, then the gladiator.

Mumuepo the Beholden and Narasimha
Kill Mumuepo first as he casts chains and a massive AOE. The unchained player must find the Thal's Scepter lever in the AOE to unchain the others before the cast finishes. Then burn down Narasimha, watching for rear tail swipes and targeted AOEs.
