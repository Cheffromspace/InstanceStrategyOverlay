Here is the cleaned up strategy guide for Matoya's Relict:

Matoya's Relict is a level 80 dungeon introduced in patch 5.4 with Shadowbringers. 

Bosses:

Mudman
The key mechanic is aiming balls of mud into the corners of the room. When tethered to a ball, line yourself up so it shoots through you into a hole in a corner. Avoid aiming at holes with little mud men inside.

Abilities:
- Hard Rock: Tankbuster, use cooldowns 
- Petrified Peat: Targeted AOE, split up to avoid overlap. Leaves mud balls.
- Peat Pelt: Tethers you to mud balls. Aim balls into corner holes. 
- Battle Breccia: Stand in front of boss or far away to avoid cone attack.
- Falling Rock: Stack to share damage.

Nixie 
Key mechanics are avoiding water pipes on the sides and jumping into a water spout to reach Nixie on a cloud during "Singing in the Rain".

Abilities:
- Smash-Crash: Creates moving tethers, avoid wind attacks. Target takes damage.
- Shower Power: Stand in line with non-glowing pipe to avoid water.
- Singing in the Rain: Jump in water spout to reach boss on cloud. Failing kills with water nova.
- Unnamed AOE: Basic group AOE, spread out.
- Unnamed Water Spouts: Avoid getting stuck and hit.

Porcine Porcelain: Mother Porxie
Run against wind to avoid kill zone while dodging AOEs. For room-wide "wind arrows", stand near boss to get blown into the safe center before a massive AOE.

Abilities: 
- Tender Loin: Moderate room-wide damage.
- Huff and Puff: Devastating room AOE. Stand near boss to get blown to safe spot. 
- Meat Mallet: Run away from targeted impact zone or get sucked and killed.
- Hidden Huff and Puff: Like normal but no ground indicators. Locate boss position based on wind current when killing the wind sprite.
- Open Flame: Targeted group AOE, don't overlap. 
- Minced Meat: Single target tankbuster.
