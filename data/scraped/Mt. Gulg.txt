Here is the cleaned up strategy guide for Mt. Gulg:

Mt. Gulg is a level 79 dungeon introduced in patch 5.0 with Shadowbringers. 

Bosses:

Forgiven Cruelty
- Rake: Tankbuster 
- Lumen Infinitum: Frontal line AOE attack with no ground marker, move away from boss' face when he starts to cast
- Cyclone Wing: Room-wide AOE
- Typhoon Wing: Don't stand in front of green orbs around boss to avoid triangular AOE attack. Further into the fight he will add aether current-looking AOE puddles as well as his orbs around him - dodge both to avoid damage

Forgiven Whimsy  
- Sacrament of Penance: Room-wide AOE
- Catechism: Tankbuster
- Judgement Day: 2 meteor puddles - 1 person will be enough to soak damage 
- Exegesis: The boss's face is a map of the platform, with the bottom corresponding to the front of the platform (toward the boss). Stand on a square without a face.
- Shiny Orbs: Occurs same time as Exegesis and spawns large donut AOEs on the ground - avoid both for no damage

Consort of Sin: Forgiven Obscenity
- Orison Fortissimo: Room-wide AOE  
- Divine Diminuendo: Puddle AOE around boss, after 1st time, 2 more AOE rings around the boss will occur quickly and with little time to spare to dodge
- Conviction Marcato: Avoid the large yellow discs surrounding the boss as they will cast a line AOE from each
- Penance Pianissimo: Tightens the map into a circle
- Feather marionette: Makes 4 copies of herself around the room. All 4 copies and the boss will cast another Divine Diminuendo - one of the copies will have a ring around them, head to this copy and stay close to avoid damage. The position of the copies and boss will then change and she will cast Conviction Marcato again - stay out of line AOEs from the copies and avoid her golden disc line AOEs too.
- Solitaire Ring: Stand on the path of the last ring to spawn, wait for others to go off and then run out of the way of the last one to avoid  
- Sacrament Sforzando: Tankbuster
