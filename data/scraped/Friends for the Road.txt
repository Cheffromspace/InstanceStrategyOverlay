Dialogue
Mehrahd: Estinien is... I think he is not as gruff as he makes out to be.

Estinien: I shall leave you to recruit G'raha. He'll appreciate the invitation that much more, I'm sure.
Estinien: As I recall, he was based at the annex. Someone there ought to be able to point you in the right direction. 
Estinien: Let us be off too, Mehrahd. Do me a favor and don't stray from the path.

Ojika Tsunjika: Oh, look who it is! Welcome back, [Forename]!  
Ojika Tsunjika: What might the Students do for you?
Ojika Tsunjika: G'raha? Yes, he's in the main hall with Mistress Krile.
Ojika Tsunjika: They've been holed up in there for days. By all means, go and give them an excuse to take a break!

G'raha Tia: Well, she wasn't hard to find, at least...
G'raha Tia: I've visited Labyrinthos on several occasions recently, but I've not set foot in Thaumazein since the day we boarded the Ragnarok...

Y'shtola: I don't see Thancred anywhere. Was he not supposed to be traveling with Urianger?

G'raha Tia: Ah, the thrill of imminent adventure! I never tire of this feeling.

Y'shtola: Just imagine the possibilities...

Urianger: In my travels, I spied many a child wandering aloneâ”€orphans, in all likelihood. Though homes razed by beasts and blasphemies can be rebuilt, the void left by those we have lost cannot so easily be filled...

Matsya: I will pray to Sanduruva for your safe return. May the wealth of Her blessings guide you to the treasure you seek...

Estinien: I send you to recruit G'raha and you return with an entire survey party.  
Estinien: I hope Matsya's boat is sturdy enough to carry us all...

Y'shtola: What he means is, we are grateful for the use of one of your precious fishing vessels.

Matsya: We are more than glad for the chance to provide it. I ask only that you take care to steer clear of the reefs in the shallows there.

Estinien: Aye, we will keep an eye out.
