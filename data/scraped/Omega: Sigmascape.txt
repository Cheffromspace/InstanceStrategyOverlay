Here is the cleaned up text for the Omega: Sigmascape strategy guide:

General Information
Omega: Sigmascape is the 2nd section of Omega, the main 8-player raid in Stormblood. Released on January 30, 2018, Sigmascape requires players with item level of 325 or higher to enter. Once unlocked, the raid can be queued from the Duty Finder.

Unlock
Players must first complete all of the Omega Quests up through The Anomaly. This includes clearing all of the Omega: Deltascape raids.
Players can then begin the level 70 quest chain starting with Return to the Rift by talking to Jessie in Rhalgr's Reach (X: 13.5, Y: 12.5).
To unlock each floor after the first, continue the quest line and complete the consecutive floor. Each floor is listed separately.
