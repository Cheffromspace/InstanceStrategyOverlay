Here is the cleaned up text for the Eden's Gate strategy guide:

Eden's Gate is the 1st section of Eden, the main 8-player raid in Shadowbringers. Released on July 16, 2019, Eden's Gate requires players with item level of 425 or higher to enter. Once unlocked, the raid can be queued from the Duty Finder.

Unlock
Completion of the level 80 quest chain starting with In the Middle of Nowhere by talking to Anxious Crystarium Guard in The Crystarium (X:9.7 Y:12.3). Players first must complete Main Scenario Quest Shadowbringers.

The guard will send you to The Empty where you will begin the Eden's Gate quest line.

To unlock each floor after the first, continue the quest line and complete the consecutive floor. Each floor is listed separately.
