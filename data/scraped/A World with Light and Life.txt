Dialogue
Y'shtola excuses herself to visit the High Crucible to have the scales inspected for signs of degradation. Varshahn will do the same for his vessel. Estinien goes to meet with the soldiers to share what he learned fighting voidsent in the Thirteenth. 

Varshahn asks you to go to Mehryde's Meyhane and request suitable refreshments for Zero when she awakens. At the meyhane, Mehryde recommends some fresh, sweet apples as they would be gentle on Zero's stomach after her long slumber.

Returning to the guest chambers, you find Zero awake. She feels invigorated by the aether-rich world. Varshahn offers to show her around the city, starting with Mehryde's Meyhane to introduce her to Mihleel and let her know where the apples came from.

At the meyhane, Zero is intrigued by the fragrant air and the dancers. Varshahn explains dancing is a form of entertainment in their culture. Zero finds it needlessly complicated compared to voidsent pleasures.

Next, Varshahn takes Zero to Balshahn Bazaar. He explains it is a marketplace where people buy and sell goods from all over using coin or tomestones. Zero is unfamiliar with the concept, as voidsent simply kill to obtain desired objects. 

The group then visits the High Crucible of Al-Kimiya where the finest alchemists reside. They created Varshahn's bodies and can provide healing. Zero is unsurprised by Varshahn occupying a created vessel, as it's common for voidsent to claim stronger bodies.

On the way back, Zero notices mulberry trees. Varshahn explains their leaves feed silkworms to make silk and the bark has medicinal uses. They then encounter two orphans, Mehrahd and Yahsra, who are excited to see Varshahn and you. 

Zero struggles to understand the concept of "friends" that the children bring up. She ponders if it's similar to Zenos' enjoyment in fighting you. Varshahn notes a child can easily answer what a friend is, while adults struggle with the question.

Zero realizes how little she actually understands this world, despite experiencing it through Zenos. Everything is strange to her but she is slowly learning, bit by bit. She feels joining you was the right decision.
