Here is the cleaned up text for the Cutter's Cry dungeon guide:

Cutter's Cry (Level 38)

Cutter's Cry is a level 38 dungeon introduced in patch 2.0.

Objectives:
- Slay all the enemies
- Clear the Feeding Pit  
- Clear the Sunken Antechamber
- Defeat the chimera

Walkthrough:
The dungeon layout is relatively straightforward, with only a few branching paths. 

In the first two rooms, the party must defeat all enemies and interact with the Shifting Sands to proceed to the next room.

In the third room, take the left path at the intersection to reach the first boss. The right path is a dead end containing only enemies and no bonus treasure coffer.  

In the section between the first and second bosses, the party will again progress by interacting with Shifting Sands. However, these are available from the start, and the party does not need to kill any enemies along the way, although they will be aggroed. It should be communicated to the party beforehand to decide whether to skip the enemies. Note that any players who get left behind and die can Release to the start of the dungeon. The rest of the party can engage the second boss. The left behind player(s) will be given an option to teleport into the boss room.

The section before the last boss contains two branching paths with a treasure coffer in each one. Many parties will skip these.
