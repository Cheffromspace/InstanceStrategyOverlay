Y'shtola is appraising the voidgate with a scholarly eye.

Dialogue:
Y'shtola and the others discuss the voidgate and Vrtra's lost sister Azdaja. Vrtra explains how his alchemists devised a way to manipulate the gate using his magic, but the knowledge has since been lost. 

The Scions share information about their own experiences with voidgates. Y'shtola requests permission to study the gate further, which Vrtra grants.

Urianger and G'raha Tia take their leave to report back to the Loporrits and meet with Krile respectively. 

Varshahn asks for the Warrior of Light's assistance in deciding how to use the vault's treasure to help his people. The Warrior of Light agrees to serve as a guest advisor along with Estinien.

Meanwhile, the Thrones of the Void sense the opening of the gate and discuss an opportunity they have been waiting for. The Knight in Black urges them to set their war in motion to win redemption for their star.
