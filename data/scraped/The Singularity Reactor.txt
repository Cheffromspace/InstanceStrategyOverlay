Here is the cleaned up text for the strategy guide on The Singularity Reactor trial in Final Fantasy 14:

The Singularity Reactor is a level 60 trial introduced in patch 3.0 with Heavensward. 

Strategy

Primal: King Thordan

Phase 1

Lightning Storm: Four players will be marked for a small lightning circle that will hit them and everyone around them after a few seconds. Simultaneously, Thordan will put AoE circles below the other four players.

Ascalon's Mercy: Several line AoEs with gaps between them.

Ancient Quaga: Moderate raidwide damage.

Ascalon's Might: Tankbuster.

Knights of the Round: At 80% HP, Thordan summons untargetable Knights of the Heavens' Ward who unleash mechanics on the party:

- Ser Janlenoux and Ser Adelphel charge around the room, putting a Bleeding debuff on everyone in their path and leaving behind damaging orbs of light. The debuff can be dispelled.

- Ser Vellguine casts a column AoE from one side of the platform to the other. 

- Ser Hermenost appears next to Thordan with three small platforms that need at least one player each or the party gets Paralysis.

The Dragon's Eye: At 55% HP, Thordan casts this and unlocks a bigger Ascalon's Mercy, and The Dragon's Gaze, a party-wide gaze attack that inflicts Terror if not looked away from.

Phase 2 

Around 10-15% HP, Thordan leaves and the Knights take over:

- Ser Charibert appears in the middle casting Heavensflame AoEs, while Ser Hermenost repeats his tower mechanic. 

- Ser Zephirin appears casting Sacred Cross AoE which can't be interrupted but deals less damage the more his HP is depleted.

- Ser Vellguine charges through the middle of the arena.

- Ser Janlenoux and Ser Adelphel engage the party directly, one casting party-wide damage and the other a tank buster.

- Ser Ignasse smashes the arena edge, dealing less damage the farther away players are.

- Ser Paulecrain places Shiva-like ice AoEs that create Heavy zones, while Ser Haumeric has a column attack targeting a player that deals less damage the closer they are to it.

- Ser Grinnaux places growing black AoE circles.

- Ser Noudenet summons comet circles that drop comets/meteors after a time. Burn them down before they land.

- Ser Guerrique appears casting a progressive AoE, avoid by moving between rows of rocks.

Thordan returns to knock players back with Light of Ascalon as the Knights teleport into position, then uses Ultimate End which deals damage based on how many Knights were defeated.

Phase 3

Depleted of energy and without the Knights, Thordan can only auto-attack with a Damage Down debuff. Defeat him to win.
