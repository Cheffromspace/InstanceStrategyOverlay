Bosses:

Spectral Thief
- Spectral Dream: Tankbuster.
- Chicken Knife: Line AOEs from each corner targeting each party member. Trust NPCs will stack in the center.
- Dash: Will teleport to marked location just before unleashing a circle AOE. Inflicts vuln stacks.
- Shadowdash: Will teleport self and shadow to two marked locations and both unleash either a circle AOE or a line AOE. AOEs are marked, just remember that he's going to move first. Inflicts vuln stacks.
- Spectral Whirlwind: Raidwide damage.
- Spectral Gust: Marked AOE on all party members. Don't stack.

Spectral Necromancer  
- Twisted Touch: Tankbuster.
- Chaos Storm: Raidwide.
- Absolute Dark II: Giant cone AOE. Inflicts cleanseable Doom. Dodge.
- Necromancy: Summons four zombies, one tethered to each party member. Summons walking zombies first, crawling zombies second, then both in succession.
  - Walking, light tether: These zombies auto you for a few seconds, then drop dead in preparation for Necroburst.
  - Crawling, smoky tether: These zombies will inflict Rigor Mortis when they catch you -- they slowly approach at first, but will instantly close the gap after an AOE marker if they haven't caught you by then.
- Necroburst: Zombies explode, inflicting heavy damage and (if they were summoned walking) vuln stacks.
- Pain Mire: Five giant circle AOEs that inflict vuln stacks and leave behind bleed puddles.
- Dark Deluge: Drops a circle AOE on each player that inflicts vuln stacks. Dodge.

Distant Ideal: Spectral Berserker
- Beastly Fury: Raidwide damage. First use will fill the arena's edges and corners with bleed puddles.
- Wild Anguish: Stack attack inflicting Magic Vulnerability Up for a few seconds.
- Raging Slice: Line AOE in front inflicting vuln stacks. Always casts several in a row -- two the first time, then three for the rest of the fight.
- Wild Rage: Instakill circle + knockback, leaving behind a crater. 
- Falling Rock: Drops a rock on each party member, then uses Wild Anguish on all of you in quick succession. Stack with the rocks to survive, not each other.
- Wild Rampage: Massive damage (almost guaranteed OHKO) and vuln stacks. Stand in the crater to avoid.
- A Bit Berserk: Standing in the crater will inflict stacks every second or so. Becomes Truly Berserk at 8 stacks, forcing you to auto the boss and take massive self-damage with each hit. Move out of the crater as soon as Wild Rampage is complete.
