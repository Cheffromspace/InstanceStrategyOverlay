Here is the cleaned up text for the strategy guide:

The Minstrel's Ballad: Tsukuyomi's Pain is a level 70 trial introduced in patch 4.3 with Stormblood. 

Strategy

First Phase (100%-80%)
- Reprimand: A raid-wide AoE that deals medium damage.
- Nightfall: Tsukuyomi will use either Lead of the Underworld (stack together to soak damage) or Steel of the Underworld (separate into three groups by role). The second cast will be whichever was not used first.
- Nightbloom: Cast at 80% health, a raid-wide AoE that stuns the party and deals heavy damage.

Adds Phase 
- Three sets of adds. Damage to Yotsuyu increases her Suffering gauge. Reaching 100 leads to a wipe.
- Tank picks up non-tethered adds. Others focus tethered adds. 
- After third set, Tsukuyomi casts a heavy raid-wide AoE.

Second Phase (80%-35%)
- Supreme Selenomancy: Players get Moonlit or Moonshadowed debuff. Manage stacks by standing on opposite color of arena floor. Avoid Lunar Halo AoEs.
- Meteor: Three players targeted, drop meteors apart. Stand in safe spot, then in matching puddle to survive Antitwilight/Perilune.
- Midnight Rain: Changes arena color, grants Full Moon or New Moon.
- Zashiki-asobi: Exploding fan AoEs, avoid and move between sets.
- Torment Unto Death: Tankbuster cleave, forces tank swap.

Third Phase (35%-0%) 
- Dance of the Dead: Starts phase.
- Full/New Moon: Gain Waxing/Waning Grudge AoE. Position to avoid.
- Bright/Dark Blade: Large side/rear AoEs. Dodge while avoiding Full/New Moon.
- Lunacy: Stack and soak damage on one player.
- Hagetsu: Spread markers on tank, healer, DPS.
- Tsuki-no-Kakera: Circular fan AoEs, move to safe spots.
- Lunacy: Enrage, stacks until wipe.
