The Twinning

Since its sudden appearance in Norvrandt, the Crystal Tower has been a source of great mystery, one which the people of the Crystarium have barely begun to unravel. Now that the city is free from the threat of the Lightwardens, researchers have been afforded the opportunity to explore the innermost reaches of the tower, though they soon found their way barred by hordes of ferocious guardians. An aetherial disturbance detected from inside is believed to be in some way linked to their appearance, and you have been tasked with not only clearing a path for the researchers, but with investigating the cause of the anomaly.

Objectives:
- Arrive at Repurposing
- Clear Repurposing 
- Arrive at Aetherial Observation
- Clear Aetherial Observation
- Arrive at Cornice
- Defeat the Tycoon

Bosses:

Alpha Zaghnal
- Augurium: Tankbuster. Hits in a cone-shaped area directly in front of the Alpha Zaghnal. This attack targets the ground, so the Tank can dodge it by stepping out of the way.
- Beastly Roar: Moderate damage to the group.
- Pounce Errant: Large player-targeted circle AoEs on each player. Alpha Zaghnal will jump to each player in sequence, dealing damage to players in the area.
- Forlorn Impact: Marks each player with a number one through four, then fires a line attack at each player in sequence, dealing damage to all players in the line.
- Charge Eradicated: Stack marker on one player. Afterwards, a large fire puddle will spawn where the attack hit, inflicting Burns to players standing in it. Once the first attack hits, a second stack marker will appear on another player with the same effects.
- Beta Zaghnal: The east and west sides of the platform each have four containment units. If one of the Alpha Zaghnal's player-targeted attacks also hits a containment unit, it will shatter and free the Beta Zaghnal held inside. Once freed, a Beta Zaghnal will aggro onto the player who freed it.

Mithridates
- Thunder Beam: Tankbuster.
- Electric Discharge: Places a number of purple orbs around the area. Those orbs will discharge after a time, dealing area damage around them.
- Laserblade: Line area of effect, crosswise with secure spots in-between. 
- Allagan Thunder: Circle AoE centered on each player.
- Eventually, Mithridates will begin using all of its non tankbuster abilities simultaneously. When this happens, Allagan Thunder will only target the Tank and Healer.

Artificial Enigma: The Tycoon
- Rail Cannon: Tankbuster.
- Magitek Crossray: Four rectangular laser AoEs in the cardinal directions from the boss. After a few seconds, the areas will be released from Temporal Stasis and become line attacks travelling outward. Causes very high damage and inflicts a stack of Vulnerability Up. The Tycoon telegraphs the lasers firing by counting down in a text box. Note that these lasers spawn on the outside of the Tycoon's hitbox and shoot toward the edge, leaving the spot where it was standing safe.
- Defensive Array: Similar to Magitek Crossray, except the AoEs appear from the outside and shoot in toward the center of the platform. 
- Temporal Stasis: Running into a time-stopped laser will cause a Temporal Paradox, spreading the laser's damage to the entire party while also inflicting Vulnerability Up on the offending player.
- Artifical Gravity: Black and red circle AoEs that grow in size after a few seconds before finally going off, dealing high damage.
- High-tension Discharger: Moderate damage to the entire party.
- Magicrystal: Circle AoEs targeted on each player.

Lore:
Throughout the dungeon, players can find notes left behind that provide insight into the Ironworks's efforts to save The Source:

"Our only hope lies in the Crystal Tower, though it did not yield its secrets easily. Even opening the doors was a monumental undertaking. Without the founder's datalogs and the NOAH reports left by the Sons of Saint Coinach, we would never have stood a chance of succeeding. 
None of us were prepared for the spectacle that awaited us when we first stepped into the tower. To be surrounded by the marvels of a lost age took our breath away. And there, at its center, we found him."

"Our research into the Emperor's Throne is almost complete, as we now understand the methods used to open a doorway to the World of Darkness, otherwise known as the Thirteenth.
However, this is only the beginning of our plan. Even if we find a way to the First, it is already too late to prevent the Eighth Umbral Calamity. For that, we must travel not only to another world, but to another time.
Thankfully, the datalogs gathered over the years, detailing battles with various primals, pointed us in the right direction."

"Just as we thought the pieces were in place, we came to the realization that traversing time and space has its... difficulties. It is one thing to possess the technology necessary to enable such a feat, quite another to actually perform it. 
The interdimensional rift, as it was called in the founder's datalogs, is what I can only describe as "infinite chaos." To navigate it would take expertise far beyond our ken.
There was, however, once a being capable of exactly that: The one known as "Omega." And yet, despite all of the research carried out, the mystery of how it was able to cross the rift remains unsolved."
