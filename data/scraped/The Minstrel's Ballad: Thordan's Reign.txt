Here is the cleaned up strategy guide for The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign:

Strategy

Before the fight:
- Assign players the following positions:
     MT
   M1  M2
 H1      H2
   R1  R2
     OT
- Assign tanks to knights in Phase 3 (east/west)
- Assign dps positions for Skyward Leap (typically North → South → North)

Phase 1: Thordan
- Tank Thordan facing away from party due to Ascalon's Might (frontal cleave)
- When Thordan casts Dragon's Gaze, turn around to avoid hysteria
- Spread for Lightning Storm, then stack behind Thordan to split damage from Dragon's Rage
- Tanks/healers watch for tankbuster Heavenly Heel, followed by Ascalon's Might
- Phase ends at 70% HP. Thordan becomes untargetable and leaves sword behind North.
- Thordan should be below 75% HP to meet enrage. Outer ring now deals 9999 damage.

Phase 2a: Conviction Towers  
- Stack middle, spread to positions when Heavensflames spawn, break Holy Chains
- Avoid Heavensflames, stand in towers (1 person per tower)

Phase 2b: Sacred Cross + Spiral Thrust
