Here is the cleaned up version of the Antitower strategy guide:

The Antitower is a level 60 dungeon introduced in patch 3.2 with Heavensward. 

Bosses:

Zuro Roggo
- The first boss in the dungeon. 
- Spawns adds (Choirtoad) throughout the fight. 
- Inflicts debuff toad on two players that can't be dispelled and spawns two adds, these must be killed to dispel the debuff (usually hits the Healer and one DPS). 
- Spawns two bubbles that inflict moderate damage and the debuff Damage Down.
- Be sure to kill the adds quickly if your Healer is inflicted with Toad.
- Abilities:
  - Toy Hammer: Has a cast time on the Tank, causes a DOT (Concussion) that can be dispelled.
  - Water Bomb: Circular AoE that inflicts moderate damage.

Ziggy 
- The second boss, a spriggan.
- Spawns three stones called Stardust with expanding AoE that need to be killed before the platform is covered. They become solid after the AoE. 
- Emotes "Ziggy takes careful aim" and tethers to one player, can be avoided by hiding behind a stone.
- Spawns adds, Spriggan Gemcutter, that need to be killed.
- Abilities:
  - Jittering Glare: Frontal cone AoE.
  - Gyrating Glare: Platform-wide AoE for high damage, can be dodged by hiding behind the stones.

Calcabrina
- A giant doll that starts out as 6 smaller dolls, 3 Calca and 3 Brina, that do various AoE patterns. Merges after the small ones are dead to Calcabrina.
- Be sure to kill Calca and Brina quickly, as it can hit your Healer and your party will take medium damage throughout the dollhouse phase. 
- Look away from her if you or another player has a red eye above their head.
- Abilities: 
  - Dollhouse: Transforms two players into dolls (Calca and Brina) that cause a DOT on these players. The dolls need to be killed to free the player and end this phase.
  - Slapstick: A channeled AoE that she casts while Dollhouse is active.
  - Knockout: Has a medium cast time and inflicts massive damage on the tank (or other players if the tank is dead).
  - Brace: Parry attacks from a certain direction.
  - Terrifying Glance: Targets a player with a red eye above their head and blasts everything in their direction with a frontal cone. Causes confusion if hit. This attack can be avoided by looking away from the boss.
