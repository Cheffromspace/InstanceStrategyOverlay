Here is the cleaned up strategy guide for The Singularity Reactor (Unreal):

Guide

Before the fight:
- Assign players the following positions: MT, M1, M2, H1, H2, R1, R2, OT
- Assign tanks to knights in Phase 3 (east/west)
- Assign DPS positions for Skyward Leap (typically North → South → North)

Phase 1: Thordan
- Tank Thordan facing away from party due to Ascalon's Might (frontal cleave)
- When Thordan casts Dragon's Gaze, turn around to avoid hysteria
- Spread out for Lightning Storm, then stack behind Thordan to split damage from Dragon's Rage
- Tanks and healers watch for tankbuster, Heavenly Heel
- Ascalon's Might follows Heavenly Heel, so healers help tank recover quickly
- Phase ends after Heavenly Heel → Ascalon's Might, or when Thordan's HP reaches 70%
- Thordan's HP should be below 75% to meet enrage
- Outer ring of arena now deals 9999 damage per tick

Phase 2a: Conviction Towers
- Party stacks middle, spreads to pre-assigned positions when Heavensflames spawn, breaking Holy Chains 
- Prioritize breaking chains over moving to position
- Four Conviction Towers spawn at cardinal directions
- Avoid Heavensflames, stand in a tower
- If each tower has one person, mechanic completed successfully, else party paralyzed

Phase 2b: Sacred Cross + Spiral Thrust
- Ser Zephirin spawns middle, casts Sacred Cross (DPS check)
- Bring Ser Zephirin below 50% HP to survive Sacred Cross
- After, Spiral Thrust Knights charge down center
- Avoid by standing at center of leaf-like decals at edge of arena

Phase 3: Two Knights
- Ser Adelphel (west) and Ser Janlenoux (east) spawn
- Divine Right gives one Sword Oath, other Shield Oath
- Tank separately at edges or they tether and share buffs
- DPS focus Sword Oath knight
- First tankbuster Holy Bladedance after Divine Right
- Sword Oath tank uses heavy cooldowns/invuln, Shield Oath tank single cooldown
- Spiral Thrust Knights appear center for Skyward Leap
- 3 DPS marked one after other, move N/S/N when marked, party takes damage based on proximity 
- Knights cast second Divine Right (swaps stances) and Heavenly Slash on tanks
- Holiest of Holy (raidwide AoE) then second Holy Bladedance, top up party and tanks
- Divine Right → Holiest of Holy → Holy Bladedance repeats until both knights dead
- Significantly easier if one knight dies fast

Phase 4a: Dimensional Collapse + Spiral Pierce + Hiemal Storm
- Stack center, spread to positions when Dimensional Collapse appears
- 3 players tethered to center knight, 5 marked for Hiemal Storm
- After Spiral Pierce and Hiemal Storm, stack center for knockback
- Orient to not get knocked into frost circles

Phase 4b: Meteors + Heavy Impact 
- Healers remove Frostbite debuffs
- 8 Comet Circles spawn at cardinal directions, 1 Meteor Circle center
- Party survives 1 Comet touching floor, determine which to ignore in advance
- Focus Meteor Circle after comets explode
- Some marked for Holy Meteor (light AoE damage), avoid stacking marked players
- Ser Hermenost spawns center, casts Heavy Impact (concentric rings)
- Avoid by moving to safe sector or crossing rings as inner explodes

Phase 4c: Ultimate End
- Thordan reappears after Meteor Circle destroyed 
- Knights use The Light of Ascalon (minor damage + small knockback)
- Shield raid for Ultimate End, damage increases per dead party member

Phase 5: Spear of Fury
- Tank Thordan north, MT at 11 o'clock, party 1 o'clock 
- Dragon's Eye spawns real eye at arena edge, avoid looking at both for Dragon's Gaze
- First Dragon's Eye always north, then random
- Knights of the Round summons Adelphel and Janlenoux 
- Mark healer for Holy Shield Bash (stun + magic vuln up)
- Marked healer moves to edge, OT closest to center, DPS between OT and healer
- Ser Zephirin spawns middle, casts Spear of Fury at marked healer
- OT stands between Zephirin and healer using cooldowns, DPS between OT and healer
- Death to Spear causes Zephirin enrage and wipe
- Players hit get Infirmary debuff (healing down)
- Thordan casts Heavenly Heel on MT during Spear
- Top up MT, turn to dodge Dragon's Gaze, then heal raid for Ancient Quagga

Phase 6: Conviction Towers + Dragon's Gaze + Heavy Impact
- Thordan casts Dragon's Eye, MT moves him to new eye location facing eye
- Knights of the Round summons Guerrique, Hermenost, then Grinnaux 
- Two knights spawn in line (--), four towers perpendicular through center (|)
- Towers always in --|  shape, helps prevent deaths if lined up facing away from eye
- Each tower needs one person to avoid party damage/paralysis 
- Each Heavy Impact ring affects half of tower, move to outer half
- Melee inner towers, ranged outer, tanks/healers fill
- Dragon's Gaze happens as first Impact ring explodes, tower check on second
- After towers, Grinnaux spawns Dimensional Collapse at each player
- Stack middle for Grinnaux knockback and Thordan's Dragon's Rage 
- MT splits from group after, avoid hitting with Ascalon's Might cleave

Phase 7: Lightning Storm + Skyward Leap + Spiral Thrust + Dragon's Rage
- Ignore Dragon's Eye, no Dragon's Gaze
- Thordan casts Lightning Storm like Phase 1
- Knights Vellguine, Ignasse
