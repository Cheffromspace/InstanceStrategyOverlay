Strategy

Lord of the Inferno: Ifrit

100% - 76% HP
- Standard tank and spank. The boss should be faced away from the party as it will periodically use a cleaving fire breath.

75% - 51% HP
- Periodically uses Eruption, a targeted radial AoE. Move to avoid.

50% - 26% HP
- Spawns an Infernal Nail. This is a DPS check. The nail must be killed immediately. After a certain period of time or if the nail is killed, the boss will become untargetable and use Hellfire. This attack will wipe the party if the nail is not killed and will inflict a moderate amount of partywide damage if it is killed.

25% - 0% HP
- Eruption now creates a ring of non-targeted area-denial AoEs. This ring can appear around the perimeter of the arena or in the center of the arena. Both rings can appear one after the other.
