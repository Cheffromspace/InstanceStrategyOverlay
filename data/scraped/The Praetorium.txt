    - Heirsbane: Each Phantom Gaius will target a random player, dealing moderate damage to them.
    - Ductus: The party will continue to be bombarded with this and Phantasmata as they battle each Phantom Gaius.

Lore

The Hour Of Reckoning
A fortress within a fortress rising at the heart of Castrum Meridianum, the Praetorium houses the XIVth Imperial Legion's command center, wherefrom Gaius van Baelsar directed his army's operations realm wide. 
Occupying the underground levels is a magitek research facility headed by Tribunus Nero tol Scaeva, a brilliant engineer responsible for the development of myriad machina of war. Of the many projects to his name, none was more groundbreaking than the revival of the Ultima Weapon. Created to suppress eikons, it was the Black Wolf's key to his conquest of Eorzeaâ€”and the Alliance's primary target in Operation Archon.

The Ultima Weapon
A counter-primal weapon of unparalleled might, the Ultima Weapon is a relic of ancient Allag discovered deep beneath Gyr Abania in a nigh-forgotten, ruin-sized site. Through the ingenuity of Nero tol Scaeva, it was restored to working order and made battle-ready, but dark rumors surround its source of power, the Heart of Sabik, which some claim was gifted from the Ascians.  

Gaius van Baelsar
A general and governor both, his many accomplishments include the conquest and political assimilation of five enemy cities. Fearsome in battle, he personally rose to challenge those adventurers who stormed Castrum Meridianum, wielding his gunblade Heirsbane with deadly effect.

The ancient magick sealed within the Ultima Weapon wreaked untold havoc, tearing open a crater of charred steel. Defeated, Gaius van Baelsar is said to have been consumed by ravenous flames.
