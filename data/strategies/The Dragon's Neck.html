<span class="boss">Ultros and Typhon</span>:<br>
- Tank Ultros and Typhon separately, DPS focus Typhon<br>
- Players transformed into Imps periodically<br>
- As Imps, get hit by Ultros' <span class="ability">Aqua Breath</span> 🔵 to gain <span class="mechanic">Wet Plate stacks</span> (aim for 2 per DPS)<br>
- When Typhon casts <span class="ability">Big Sneeze</span> in center, Imps use <span class="ability">Imp Punch</span> on him (need 8 total Wet Plate stacks to stop cast)<br>
- In next Imp phase, avoid Typhon's rotating <span class="ability">Snortsault</span> ➡️⬅️ line AoEs while getting Wet Plate stacks<br>
- <span class="note">💡 If Imp Punch fails, preemptively jump out of arena to avoid wipe</span><br>
- Dodge various AoEs throughout fight<br>
- When Typhon casts <span class="ability">Snort</span> in center, <span class="mechanic">move towards middle</span> to avoid 💨 knockback off arena<br>
- 🚫 Wipe if all players knocked out of arena<br>
