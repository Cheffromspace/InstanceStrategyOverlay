    <span class="note">
    The key to success is quickly identifying and reacting to Kefka's "trick" mechanics, properly handling the Statue's abilities during Graven Image phases, and efficiently dealing with the overlapping mechanics in the final phase. Healers must be prepared for heavy raid damage and tankbusters throughout. Coordinate meteor soaks, knockbacks, and tether mechanics to survive.
