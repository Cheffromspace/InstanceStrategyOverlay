    <span class="note">The key to this fight is properly managing the Renauds and Cursed Voice/Shriek mechanics. Coordinate petrifying Renauds and hiding behind them to avoid party-wide petrification. Focus down adds quickly, especially the Lamia Prosector before Melusine absorbs it. Stay spread for Fireballs and avoid poison areas in the later phase.</span>
