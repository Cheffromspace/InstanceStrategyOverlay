Overview:
The Crown of the Immaculate (Extreme) is a level 80 trial introduced in patch 5.0 with Shadowbringers. The trial features three phases, with the first and last phases containing massive mechanical overlaps and copious amounts of AoE that will test the positioning and reactions of all participants. The second phase serves as a simple DPS check versus three adds while Innocence himself remains inactive and invulnerable.

Phases & Abilities:
- Shadowreaver: An unavoidable raid-wide AoE. Healers should be ready to top-up the entire group whenever necessary.
- Righteous Bolt: A vicious and frequently used tankbuster which applies a lightning-based debuff to the primary target. Tanks need to perform tank-swaps as soon as possible.

Phase 1:
- Winged Reprobation: Summons resplendent swords that tether to random party members. Tethered players should move away from the party to drop circle AoEs. Swords will then fire beams at the marked locations.
- Rightful Reprobation: A two-part mechanic with blue AoE-markers. Spears will be fired through these markers, then shoot back across the arena in the opposite direction after a delay.
- Rotating Swords: A large resplendent sword will carve the arena in a rotating fan-like AoE. Players must remain in the safe-zones.
- Drop of Light: Marks two random players with large AoE markers that will detonate, forcing them to move away from the party.
- Light Pillar: A line-directed stack-mark AoE that targets a random healer. Players must stack along the line to share damage.

Phase 2:
Innocence becomes invulnerable and summons two Forgiven Venerys and one Forgiven Shame. This phase is a DPS check - all adds must be killed before Innocence is fully charged to avoid a wipe.

Phase 3:
- Starbirth: Creates three shining orbs around the arena which will explode if they collide with mechanics. Pull Innocence away from the orbs.
- Beautific Vision: Innocence flies to the arena's edge and then through the center in a straight line. Players should run to the edge to avoid damage.
- God Ray: A tri-directional AoE that fires from the arena center. Stand in the thin safe-spots between the AoEs.

The final phase rotates through various mechanical combinations involving Starbirth, Drop of Light, Winged Reprobation, Rightful Reprobation and Rotating Swords. The hard enrage is a long cast of Beatific Vision which will wipe the party if the boss is not defeated in time.

Loot:
- 1 Immaculate Totem per player per kill. 5 totems can be exchanged for accessories, 99 for the Innocent Gwiber Trumpet mount.
- 15 Allagan Tomestone of Poetics
- Innocence Card (fixed drop rate)
- Treasure Coffer containing iLvl 450 accessories and orchestrion roll
