Defeat Aenc Thon, Lord of the Lengthsome Gait.

Bosses:

Aenc Thon, Lord of the Lingering Gaze
- Candy Cane: Tankbuster.
- Hydrofall: Two circle AoEs below random players. Deals high damage to players hit.
- Laughing Leap: Alternates between a small circle AoE in the center of the arena or a stack marker on a random player. Aenc Thon will leap to the targeted area and follow up with Landsblood.
- Landsblood: Constant party-wide damage every few seconds, combined with several blue water AoE markers appearing around the arena. The more opaque the markers become, the closer they are to "exploding", dealing moderate damage and Stunning players caught in the area of effect.

Griaule 
- Swinge: 60 degree frontal AoE cone
- Fodder: Griaule will move to the center of the arena and summon five untargetable Painted Sapling adds that will then tether to him. These tethers can and should be intercepted by players, and after a short time, the adds will bestow the Growing buff to whomever they were tethered to. 
- The Growing buff increases damage dealt and reduces damage taken, along with physically increasing the target's size. Players who gain a second stack of Growing will have it replaced with Full-Grown, which further increases the benefits gained from Growing, but the boss will continue to gain stacks.
- Tiiimbeeer: Moderate party-wide damage.
- Coiling Ivy: Four Painted Ivy adds will appear on each player and inflict Fetter, binding them in place. The adds can be targeted and destroyed to remove the debuff.

Lakelord: Aenc Thon, Lord of the Lengthsome Gait
- Crippling Blow: Tankbuster.
- Virtuisic Capriccio: Moderate party-wide damage and a weak Bleed debuff on all players. Late in the fight, Aenc Thon will cast this ability three times in a row, but the Bleed debuff does not stack. 
- Imp Choir: Gaze attack that transforms any player hit into an Imp for 6 seconds.
- Toad Choir: Aenc Thon will turn to face a random player and cast a wide, untelegraphed frontal cone AoE. Players in the cone are transformed into a Toad for 6 seconds.
- Funambulist's Fantasia: Aenc Thon will move to the back of the arena, knock all players back to the entrance of the arena, and creates a massive gap in the center of the room. A single, narrow and winding path is the only way across the pit. Players that fall into the pit are teleported back to the start, but are otherwise unharmed. Players' mobility and teleporation skills cannot be used to bypass the maze. At the same time, Aenc Thon will become surrounded in a barrier, summon the Liar's Lyre, and the two will begin casting Finale.
- Liar's Lyre: The Liar's Lyre can only be damaged if you are inside Aenc Thon's barrier. Destroying the lyre will interrupt the Finale cast and stun Aenc Thon for a short time. 
- Finale: If the cast finishes, Finale will instantly kill any player not inside Aenc Thon's barrier. Once Finale has finished either by being cast or being interrupted, the arena will return to normal.
- Changeling's Fantasia: Aenc Thon transforms into the Shade of Fear. After a few attacks from the Shade, Aenc Thon will transform back to normal. If the battle lasts long enough for him to cast this a second time, he will instead transform into a tiny helpless frog.
- Corrosive Bile: Very wide lingering cone attack from the Shade of Fear's front. 
- Flailing Tentacles: The Shade of Fear will raise its four tentacles and slam them down in a line attack. Deals moderate damage and inflicts Concussion, dealing high damage over time.
