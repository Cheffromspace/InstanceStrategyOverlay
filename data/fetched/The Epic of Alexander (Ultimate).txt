Here is the cleaned up strategy guide for The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate) raid in Final Fantasy 14:

Phase 1: Living Liquid

Mechanics:
- Fluid Strike/Swing: Hard-hitting tankbuster cleave that debuffs with Water Resistance Down. 
- Cascade: Raid-wide damage that spawns three Liquid Rages around the arena. Avoid the puddles they spawn on.
- Liquid Hand: Boss splits HP and summons this add. Keep boss and hand HP within 4% of each other.
- Hand of Prayer/Parting: Separate boss and hand if hand forms fist, bring them together if open palm. 
- Protean Wave: Conal AoEs from boss, hand, and Liquid Rages. Bait and avoid telegraphed ones, handle untelegraphed ones hitting nearest players.
- Jagd Dolls: Tether to and pulse AoE on players. Feed to boss/hand at ≤25% HP.
- Pressurize/Embolus: Orbs move from Rages to boss/hand. Avoid letting them touch anything.
- Sluice: Circular AoEs on furthest players.
- Splash: Unavoidable raid-wide damage.
- Drainage: Tanks grab tethers from Rages and mitigate damage.
- Throttle: Dispel Throttle debuff on random players or they die.

Strategy:
Pull boss north. Handle Fluid Swing, Cascade, and spawn of hand. Keep boss and hand together initially. Have OT grab hand. Separate after Hand of attack. Position for Protean Waves - ranged/healers bait. Feed Jagd Dolls in order once low. Avoid Embolus orbs. Bait more Protean Waves with specific positioning. Handle Splash, Drainage, Cascade. Dispel Throttle. Final Protean Waves and enrage Cascade. Focus boss before final Hand of Pain.

Intermission: Limit Cut

Players get numbered for Alpha Sword hits and Charge dashes. Hawk Blaster AoEs rotate and drop on arena. Groups run around arena handling mechanics in sequence. Use knockback prevention.
