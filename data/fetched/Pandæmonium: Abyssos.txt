Lore:
After a battle hard-fought, order has been restored to Asphodelos. However, the inner circles of Pandæmonium remain in the grip of a mysterious force, and the remaining warders are nowhere to be found. You and your allies steel yourselves to press forward, but what awaits in those unknown depths may shake even the most steadfast resolve.

Trivia: 
Abyssos (abyssos) is Latin for "bottomless pits."
