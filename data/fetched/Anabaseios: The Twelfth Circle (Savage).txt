The arena is a 2x4 arrangement of rectangular tiles, which is important for some mechanics.Failing most mechanics will result in aDamage Downdebuff, as well as other various effects.StrategyParadeigma 1On the Soul: Heavy raidwide damage, requiring mitigation.Paradeigma: Summons four yellow crystals, each spawning an untargetableAnthroposadd. These adds will all move to either the north or south half of the arena (two on the left and two right). Two at a time, these adds will target the two nearest players to them with a two line AoEs (White Flame) that inflict high damage andMagic Vulnerability Up.Trinity of Souls: Three of the boss's wings will begin glowing sequentially, telegraphing a half-room cleave based on which wing glows. Compared to Normal mode, if one of the bottom wings is the first to glow, the boss will rotate 180 degrees between each cleave, requiring the party to dodge into what would have been the unsafe half of the room for the second wing cleave. Note that the first usage of this ability willalwaysbe bottom-to-top.The party must bait the line AoEs to prevent overlap while dodging the half-room cleaves. A common strategy is have both tanks stack on the half of the room the adds are in and use their invulnerability cooldowns. Each set of four lasers should bait on the tanks and away from the party, greatly simplifying the mechanic.Note that the main tank will be inflicted with aMagic Vulnerability Upfrom the line AoEs that persists for one boss auto-attack, which deals magical damage. They must use heavy personal mitigation and receive targeted mitigation from the off-tank and healers to survive this auto-attack, as their invulnerability cooldown will have expired.Paradeigma 2Paradeigma: Summons four blue crystals and two red crystals, each spawning an untargetableAnthroposadd. The adds from the blue crystals will position near the cardinals off the wall.Engravement of Souls: Assigns various debuffs to players:One random support and one random DPS will haveAstralbright Soul.Another random support and DPS will haveUmbralbright Soul.When these debuffs expire, the targeted players will emit a small AoE that inflictsMagic Vulnerability Upand spawns a dark or light-aspected tower corresponding to their debuff. These towers must be quickly soaked by a player with the opposite colorTiltdebuff, or they will explode (Unmitigated Explosion) and wipe the raid, i.e. dark towers must be taken withUmbral Tiltand light towers must be taken withAstral Tilt. Players who correctly soak a tower will take minor damage (Astral Advance/Umbral Advance) and have their tierTiltdebuff color swapped. The players who previously had theSouldebuffs will also receive aTiltdebuff the same as their initial color.The players without any initial debuffs will each be tethered to one add at the edge of the arena. Two adds will have light tethers, and the others will have dark tethers. These players must stretch their tethers (indicated visually) to reduce the proximity damage from a line AoE (Shadowsear/Searing Radiance) that the add will use on them. Being hit with a line AoE will inflictMagic Vulnerability Upand the correspondingUmbral TiltorAstral Tiltbased on the tether color, allowing these players to soak the towers.To resolve this mechanic, the tethered players should stretch their tethers straight through the boss's hitbox. The players withTiltneed to position near a tethered player whose tether color is opposite their debuffs (due to the role targeting, a simple priority system can be used, e.g., DPS NW scanning counterclockwise, supports NE scanning clockwise).The line AoEs and tower debuffs will resolve at the same time. The previously tethered players need to soak their partner's tower. Soon after, allTiltdebuffs will expire.Meanwhile, the adds from the red crystals will appear on alternating columns at the north side of the arena. They will use an untelegraphed line AoE (Ray of Light) through their column, so the party will need to dodge to one without an add.On the SoulGlaukopis: A telegraphed, heavy-hitting line AoE tankbuster that hits twice and inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring a tank swap during the cast. The main tank needs toProvokeback after the second hit to prevent the off-tank from dying to the boss's subsequent auto-attacks.Superchain Theory ISuperchain Theory I: Spawns four blue clusters in the intercardinals, each chained (with various lengths) to various objects. Each object will gradually move towards its cluster. When it touches it, the cluster will use an AoE based on the object. Shorter chains will resolve faster than longer chains, and some objects will be tethered to two objects with same length chains, causing them to both resolve at once.Green orb: A large point-blank AoE from the cluster, requiring players to move away from it (same as Normal mode).Blue donut: A donut AoE centered on the cluster, requiring players to move near it (same as Normal mode).Orange spiked ball: Each player will be hit with a narrow conal AoE (Superchain Radiation) that inflicts moderate damage andMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring the party to spread around the cluster. Note that if fewer than 8 players alive, one random player will receive two hits and die.Purple jack: Either all DPS or supports with be hit with a narrow conal AoE (Superchain Emission) that deals split damage andMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring pairs of DPS and supports to spread around the cluster.The party should first locate the blue cluster with two short chains. It will always be connected to onegreen orbordonut, and oneorange spiked ballorpurple jack.Engravement of Souls: Assigns various debuffs to the party, based on their role group (DPS or supports):Role group 1(one debuff per player):One player receivesAstralbright Souland another receivesUmbralbright Soul, which function as before.One player receivesAstralstrong Souland another receivesUmbralstrong Soul. When these debuffs expire, the boss will target the players with a narrow, split-damage line AoE (Astral Impact/Umbral Impact) that should be shared between four players. To survive, players must have the opposite colorTiltorSouldebuff. For example, theAstralstrong Soul(dark) laser will be shared with the one player withUmbralbright Souland two players withUmbral Tilt. All players withTiltwill have their debuff color swapped, while the others will be given aTiltdebuff matching the color of their laser they soaked.Role group 2(two debuffs per player):Two players receiveAstral Tiltand the other two receiveUmbral Tilt.All four players receiveHeavensflame Soul. When this debuff expires, the players will be hit with a medium-sized AoE (Theos's Holy) that inflicts moderate damage andMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring them to spread away from others.Once the debuffs are assigned, the chains will begin moving.From their starting cluster, the party should either fully spread around the cluster or stack with their partners while being either close or away from it, based on the two objects that it is tethered to.For example, if the cluster is tethered to a green orb and orange spiked ball, the party will fully spread away from the cluster to dodge the point-blank AoE and safely resolve the conal AoEs (proteans). Melees should be at the front, facing the boss, and ranged at the back.Afterwards, the party will rotate 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise) to thecluster only tethered to a blue donut. Here, the laser debuffs will resolve.While remaining near to the cluster to dodge the donut AoE, the party will split into two groups.++ 2:left++ 2:rightAn easy way to remember this is to look at the debuff icons themselves. The location of the tower or person (left or right) will tell you where to stand. For the laser debuffs, imagine the laser coming from the top (from the boss) and aiming downwards.After the lasers resolve, the party will rotate in the same direction to thecluster tethered to both a green orb and blue donut. Based on the length of the chains, this will be either an out-then-in dodge, or vice versa. While dodging these AoEs, the party will need to gravitate towards their final positions to resolve theAstralbright/Umbralbright SoulandHeavensflame Souldebuffs.The players withAstralbright/Umbralbright Soulshould drop their towers in predictable locations to avoid clipping others and for their partner to know where to find the tower. The most common method is forto go left andto go right, similarly as before. The towers should be placed on the cardinals at max melee range.After the towers are dropped, the two players thatpreviouslyhadAstral/Umbralstrong Soulwill need to soak the opposite color tower from theirTilt. (When dodging the AoEs, these players should avoid being near the cardinals to prevent the tower drop AoE from clipping them).The four players withHeavensflame Soulshould spread away from others. For example, tanks/melees can run through the boss's hitbox and spread to the opposite cardinals, while ranged/healers can spread near the corner of the arena. Because these debuffs are role-restricted, it is possible to pre-assign everyone spots.Trinity of Soulsis used again. This will randomly be a top-to-bottom pattern (Normal mode) or a bottom-to-up pattern, so players need to identify the pattern and dodge accordingly.Peridialogos / Apodialogos: One of these attacks will be used. Both is a combination shared tankbuster and party stack. This requires mitigation.Peridialogos: The closest player is hit with a shared AoE tankbuster, while the furthest player is hit with a split damage AoE. The tanks should stack directly inside the middle of the hitbox, while the party moves to max melee range.Apodialogos: The furthest player is hit with a shared AoE tankbuster, while the closest player is hit with a split damage AoE. The tanks should stack at max melee range, while the party stacks directly inside the middle of the hitbox.The tankbuster will inflictConcussion, dealing damage-over-time.It is possible for one tank to take the tankbuster solo with an invulnerability cooldown, while the other tank stacks with the rest of the party, which will also reduce the damage the party takes.On the SoulParadeigma 3Paradeigma: SpawnsAnthroposadds from four blue crystals and two yellow crystals. The blue crystal adds will go east and west (two per wall).Engravement of Souls: Assigns various debuffs to the tanks and healers.One random support will receiveQuartered Soul. When this debuff expires, they will drop a plus-shaped AoE telegraph (Theos's Cross) that others should avoid.Another random support will receiveX-marked Soul. When this debuff expires, they will drop an X-shaped AoE telegraph (Theos's Saltire) that others should avoid.These AoEs will always be positioned true north, not relative to where the player is facing.The remaining two supports will both receive the same debuff: eitherAstralbright SoulorUmbralbright Soul.The DPS will be tethered to the outside adds, similar to inParadeigma 2. There will be two light and two dark tethers. Adds on the same side will use the same color tether.Unnatural Enchainment: The boss will tether four alternating tiles, destroying them at the end of this cast bar. Any players standing on them will die.A tower will also spawn at the end of the four remaining safe tiles. These need to be soaked by one tank or healer by the end of the cast, which will deal damage (Shock) and inflictMagic Vulnerability Up. Any towers that are not soaked will explode (Electrify) and wipe the raid.All players will receiveEnchained Soul, preventing them from jumping. This will constrain each player's movement to a single tile for this mechanic.The two adds from the yellow crystals will appear between some tiles. TheirWhite Flamelasers need to be baited by two players each, similar toParadeigma 1.Resolving this mechanic is strictly divided by role.Supports:Quartered Soul: Soak the north-most tower. Drop AoE at the corner so it will not go through the middle. Then move in and baitWhite Flamefrom the add, away from the middle.X-marked Soul: Soak the south-most tower. Drop AoE at the south wall so it will not go through the middle. Then move in and baitWhite Flamefrom the add, away from the middle.Astralbright Soul/Umbralbright Soul: Soak the two middle towers. (A simple priority system can be used, e.g. H1 > T1 > T2 > H2 from west to east.) While soaking, be careful to not be clipped with the DPS tether lasers. These players need to also observe their debuff color and the tether colors of both DPS on their tile.If the colors match (e.g.,+ dark tethers), the support will need to drop their tower near the middle of the arena, at the corner of their tile, such that the tower overlaps into the adjacent tile. This will allow the opposite color tether DPS to soak the tower.If the colors are opposite, the support should drop their tower near the middle of their tile, being careful not to clip the DPS. This will allow the DPS on their tile to soak their tower.DPS:Stretch tether to reduce proximity damage and go to an opposite safe tile. Because two DPS (with the same color tether) will occupy one tile, one tether should be straight and the other slanted. Be careful not to stand too close and overlap AoEs.The DPS need to take note of their tether color and whetheroris active.If the colors match, the two tethered DPS on a tile will avoid soaking the towers. Instead, they will baitWhite Flamefrom the inner adds.If the colors are opposite, the DPS will each take a tower that is dropped by a support. To avoid confusion, the slanted tether player can soak the middle tower, while the straight tether player soaks the outer tower.Note that there is heavy outgoing damage during this mechanic, so healing and mitigation are needed.On the Soul: Also restores the arena floor.GlaukopisPalladion ("Limit Cut")Ultima Blade(no cast bar): This boss will say "This is but a glimpse of a god's strength!" and summon 8 untargetable adds. Afterwards it will use a hard-hitting raidwide that requires mitigation. The arena will also be compressed into a much smaller octagon that is surrounded by a lethal AoE.Adds on the cardinals have a purple sigil and intercardinal adds have a yellow sigil.The adds will begin flying away, one by one, in a random order. The order in which they disappear is the same as the order in which they will appear later. Players do not necessarily need to remember the order which they fly away, although this can help with anticipating timing in the upcoming mechanic.Palladion: The boss will become untargetable and re-appear on a random corner of the octagon, which is considered the "new north" for this mechanic. All player will receive a 1-8 "limit cut" marker over their head and need to position and move accordingly based on their number.The boss will dash to each numbered player in sequence. This dash has a line AoE (Shockwave) in the boss's path that deals proximity damage. When the boss reaches its target, it will use a split damage point-blank AoE (Palladion) that needs to be shared with another player and inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up. It will also leave behind a blue puddle that will kill anyone who touches it.Meanwhile, theAnthroposadds will begin sequentially appearing in the middle. Adds withpurpleglyphs will use a small, 270 degree conal AoE (Clear Cut) that can be ignored. However, adds withyellowglyphs will useWhite Flamelasers on the two nearest players. Therefore, pairs of players take turns baiting these lasers by moving closer to the middle. The timing of these AoEs is somewhat random, as it depends on the order in which the adds flew away.To resolve this mechanic, there are essentially four roles based on the player's number:1 and 3: Start in the south corner directly opposite the boss. After being dashed on, move clockwise just outside the puddle and wait for the next dash. Then trade places with 5/7. Move in to bait the lasers only after 6/8 take their baits.2 and 4: Start in the northeast corner from the boss. Wait for the boss's first dash, then move into the boss's starting location at north to take the second dash, which will lower proximity damage. After being dashed on, move clockwise just outside the puddle and wait for the next dash. Then trade places with 5/7. Move in to bait the lasers only after 1/3 take their baits.5 and 7: Start loosely spread towards the west corner, and in towards the center (without being too close to the middle and the boss's dash path). Keep moving clockwise as necessary to make room. Bait theWhite Flamelasers, then move back directly to the wall. After 1/3 take both their dashes, trade places with them to take the next two, moving clockwise.6 and 8: Start loosely spread directly against the southeast wall. After 5/7 take their laser baits, move a ways towards the middle to bait the next set of lasers. Keep moving clockwise as necessary to make room. After 2/4 take both their dashes, trade places with them to take the next two, moving clockwise.TheWhite Flamelaser bait order is 5/7 → 6/8 → 1/3 → 2/4The boss will reappear in the middle, face south, and destroy the middle four tiles, so the party should all stack north.Theos's Ultima: A heavy-hitting raidwide whose damage is split between the current number of alive players, meaning too many dead players at this point will likely wipe the party.Superchain Theory IIASuperchain Theory IIA: Spawns three blue clusters: one north, one middle, and one south. Each is chained to multiple objects with chains of different lengths.Players should locate the cluster (north or south) with theshort purple chain. This cluster will always have a long tether to a green orb, orange spiked ball, or purple jack, which will determine movement during this mechanic.The boss will begin castingTrinity of Souls(always bottom-to-top). Players need to stack with their assigned partner on the half of the room near the first cluster that is safe from the first half-room wing cleave. The melees at front should be careful not to be clipped by the point-blank AoE from the green orb contacting the middle cluster. The party should take note of the boss's glowing wings.Afterwards, the party will quickly move to the middle cluster to resolve an incomingblue donutAoE, while dodging the second wing cleave.Thirdly, the party will either continue running straight ahead or return to the first cluster while dodging the third wing cleave.If the first cluster had along pink or orange chain, the party will return to it.If the first cluster had along green chain, the party will continue running straight ahead, as the opposite cluster will always have a pink or orange chain.Finally, after dodging the third wing cleave, the party will spread out (or stack with partners) to resolve the mechanic from thefinal orange spiked ball or purple jack. Once again, the melees at front should be careful not to be clipped by the point-blank AoE from the green orb contacting the middle cluster.Peridialogos / Apodialogos: Functions similarly as before. Recommended for one tank to take the buster solo with an invulnerability, if possible.On the SoulSuperchain Theory IIBSuperchain Theory IIB: Initially spawns two blue clusters: one north of center and the other south of center. One will be chain to a green orb and other to a blue donut, so the party should start in the donut.The boss will castParadeigmaand spawn two adds from red crystals.Meanwhile, two more clusters will spawn: one east of center and the other west of center, will spawn. Each one has a medium-length chain: one to a green orb, and the other to a orange spiked ball or purple jack.Finally, two more clusters will spawn: one north and the other south. Each one has long chains: one will be chained to a green orb, and the other will be chained to both a green orb and an orange spiked ball.This mechanic has a simple resolution.Starting from thesingular donut cluster, move to either east or west depending on which one has theorange or purple chain.The boss will castParthenos, a line AoE through its hitbox that will knock back anyone hit. Dodge this AoE, then adjust to resolve the spreads or pair stacks.While doing so, players should take note of the adds on the north side of the arena (similar toParadeigma 2) and dodge to a gap between them to avoid their line AoEs after the second cluster mechanic. Note that the gap is narrower than before.Finally, the party will move to the the cluster tethered toboth a green orb and orange spiked ball, then resolve the out + spread mechanic.During this, the boss will begin castingUnnatural Enchainment, tethering and then destroying 7 of the 8 tiles. The lone safe tile will always be one of the four tiles surrounding the final cluster.On the Soulwill then be used twice, the first restoring the arena floor.After two more auto-attacks, the boss will become untargetable and cast a hard enrageTheos's Ultima, wiping the party. The boss's health must be fully depleted before becoming untargetable or the party will wipe.Pallas AthenaThe party will receive a checkpoint upon defeating Athena's first form and pulling Pallas Athena, so they will restart from here if they wipe. The southern row of tiles of the arena has been removed, so the arena is now a 2x3 arrangement of tiles.In addition to the same light parties and partners from Phase 1, players should also assign a horizontal "conga line" of players and a "q"-formation spread spots for later mechanics.StrategyUltima: Heavy raidwide damage that requires mitigation.Palladian Grasp: The main tank will receive a diffuse AoE tankbuster marker, indicating they will be hit with a heavy-hitting tankbuster that cleaves the entire half the room they are standing on and inflictsPhysical Vulnerability Up. This attack hits twice, requiring a tank swap, or preferably taking both with an invulnerability cooldown to minimize movement. The rest of the party needs to be on the other half of the room from the targeted tank.Gaiaochos 1 ("UAV 1")Gaiaochos: Heavy raidwide damage that requires mitigation. Will also compress the arena to a much smaller circular region in a sphere and gives everyone theAscendeddebuff, shrinking their character and reducing movement speed.Summon DarknessSummons three untargetableHemitheosadds at random cardinals and intercardinals past the arena edge, leaving two opposite cardinals or intercardinals safe. These will each begin charging a line AoE (Ultima Ray) through where they are facing.Each player will receive an overhead chain marker. They party should tightly stack middle until theMissing Linkdebuff appears, tethering each DPS to a random support. The party will need to break their chains by running away from each other and towards the opposite safe spots. Failing to do so in time will inflict high damage andDamage Down.Demi Parhelion: Nine circular AoE telegraphs will appear in a 3x3 grid, leaving gaps in between.Geocentrism: The boss's tentacles will use one of three telegraphs:Tentacles wrapping roughly north and south: The AoEs will propagate vertically, leaving two narrow columns safe.Tentacles wrapping east and west: The AoEs will propagate horizontally, leaving two narrow rows safe.Tentacles wrapping around the equator of the sphere: The AoEs will propagate in a circle, leaving a narrow ring safe.Meanwhile, each player will be marked with an orange marker, indicating they will be targeted for a small AoE (Divine Excoriation) that deals damage and inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up, requiring the party to fully spread in the safe region.Note that the propagating AoEs will persist for several seconds, so do not move into them until the animation disappears.Ultima: Heavy raidwide damage and removesAscended, restoring the arena to its original shape.The Classical Concepts 1The Classical Concepts: Heavy raidwide damage, requiring mitigation.Each player will be given an overhead "Playstation" symbol (blue X, purple square, red O, green triangle), identifying pairs of players for this mechanic. The debuffsAlpha TargetandBeta Targetwill each be assigned to the members of a pair.A few seconds later, the symbols will disappear and the player pairs will be tethered withShackled Together. If tethered players move too far apart from each other, both players will instantly die (Tilted Balance), causing a wipe.A 4x3 grid of shapes will appear, consisting of four blue icosahedrons (Concept of Water), four red pyramids (Concept of Fire), and four yellow cubes (Concept of Earth).Each row has one blue icosahedron. Each icosahedron will always be adjacent at least one red pyramid and at least one yellow cube. It is not possible for a blue icosahedron to be adjacent to two red pyramids and two yellow cubes.Several seconds after they spawn, each red pyramid and yellow cube will tether a blue isocahedron next to them, fuse with it, and explode (Fusion Burst), instantly wiping the party. To prevent the shapes from fusing, each blue-red and blue-yellow pair must be intercepted by a player.To determine who goes where, players should refer to their "Playstation" markers. A common strategy is the "BPOG" method, in which the blue X players intercept the icosahedron in the first (left-most) column, the purple square players take the second column, the red O players take the third column, and the green triangle players take the fourth column.Alpha Targetplayers should block a red pyramid. (These debuffs are mostly for convenience: there is no hard-coded requirement that Alpha players block red pyramids to prevent fusion).Beta Targetplayers should block a yellow cube.Commonly, a blue icosahedron will have two of the same shape adjacent to it. To resolve this ambiguity, players need to block the shape that isnotadjacent toa differentblue icosahedron.Each layout of shapes has only one possible solution. If the shapes were not all correctly blocked, the tethers will indicate what the correct solution should have been, before the party wipes.Correctly blocked shapes will tether to players instead and hit them with a single-target attack (Aspect Effect) that deals moderate damage andMagic Vulnerability Up.All shapes will then emit a very briefly telegraphed point-blank AoE (Implode), requiring players to move away from them (e.g, towards the edge of the arena, or in the middle between four shapes).Palladian Ray: The boss will plunge a tentacle to the west and east part of the arena. Each one will target the four closest players with it with a persistent conal AoE (Palladian Ray) that inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up. If players are hit with more than one initial AoE, or linger in their original AoE, they will die.The party should bait these cones in a "K" or "X" formation near the tentacles to prevent overlap and leave safe spots to dodge into.To determine who goes where, players can try to preposition or use body language prior to the tentacles spawning. However, a systematic way of resolving this is forAlpha Targetto always bait north,Beta Targetto always bait south, and for players to bait in their original column based on their Playstation marker.Caloric Theory 1UltimaCrush Helm: The top two enmity players will be hit with four-hit single-target tankbusters that inflict minor damage and a stack ofMagic Vulnerability Up. These must be quickly removed withEsunaorThe Warden's Paean, as they will then be hit with a follow-up tankbuster that deals massive damage and will kill them if they have this vulnerability up debuff.Alternatively, these can be taken with an invulnerability cooldown.If apaladinusesCoveron their co-tank, the co-tank will not receive these vulnerability stacks. However, both tanks will still take damage from the final hit, requiring mitigation.Caloric Theory: Heavy raidwide damage, requiring mitigation.During the cast bar, one random support and one random DPS will receive an orange overhead beacon. This indicates that when the cast finishes, one of the two will randomly be targeted with a small, split-damage AoE that should be shared between at least 2 players.A blue rectangular grid will appear on the floor to assist with positioning.The following debuffs are assigned in this mechanic:Pyrefaction: When this debuff expires, the target player will emit a small AoE (Pyre Pulse) that deals damage and must be shared with one other player without this debuff. A player with this debuff will be indicated with a fiery overhead marker for easy identification.Atmosfaction: When this debuff expires, the target player will emit a medium-sized AoE (Dynamic Atmosphere) that deals damage and will knock back and kill anyone else in the AoE.Close Caloric: A stacking debuff that will cause a player who dies or receives5 stacksto explode (Unmitigated Explosion) and instantly wipe the raid. A stack is gained from moving 9 yalms (slightly longer than the diagonal length of a grid rectangle) or from being hit withPyre Pulse.Four random players will start with 1 stack ofand.The other four players will start with 2 stacks ofand.These will always include the two beacon players during the cast.The goal of this mechanic is to resolve the stack and spread debuffs while limiting movement to prevent excess stacks of.Given that the beacon players will always haveand are role-restricted, the party can mostly preposition.Initially, players must form four pairs to resolve the first fourdebuffs. This requires eachplayer to stack with aplayer.After the first stacks, the following should be resolved:Thedebuffs will soon expire, so these players must then move away from others to avoid clipping anyone with their AoE, while limiting movement.Two random players that hadwill receive the same debuff again. They must form two new pair stacks with the remaining players with no debuff.Thespreads and second set ofstacks will resolve, concluding the mechanic. If executed correctly, all players will have four stacks of. Players should be careful not to move until theirdebuffs expire.Ekpyrosis: Spawns one of two sets of AoE telegraphs.Two proximity markers north and south, and four horizontal "exaflare" telegraphs (two west and two east). The exaflares will be on alternating rows, leaving gaps in between. The party should split to the west and east walls based on their light party assignments, with tanks/melees in front.Two proximity markers west and east, and four diagonal "exaflare" telegraphs (two north and two south). The exaflares will be on alternating rows, leaving gaps in between. The party should split to the north and south walls, with tanks/melees north.Players need to be as far away from the proximity markers as possible as they will deal massive damage.After the initial proximity and first exaflare AoEs resolve, each light party will spread along their wall, because each player will be hit with a large AoE that inflictsMagic Vulnerability Up.After the spreads, the party should collapse back to the middle while dodging the remaining exaflares.PangenesisUltimaPangenesis: Massive shared raidwide damage based on the number of people alive, requiring mitigation. During the cast, the party should go to their horizontal "conga line" positions, preferably with the tank who is taking the follow-upPalladian Graspbuster at the far right, for consistency. The party will receive several debuffs.Unstable Factor: A stacking debuff that must fully be cleansed before the duration expires, or the afflicted player will explode (Ex-factor) and instantly wipe the raid.Two random players start with1 stackof.Four other random players start with2 stacksof. Each of these players will also have an additional debuff:One player will have a 16s ("short") durationAstral Tilt, and another will have a 16s durationUmbral TiltOne player will have a 20s ("long") durationAstral Tilt, and the remaining will have a 20s durationUmbral TiltThese function similarly to in Phase 1.To cleanse, two players must stack on top of each other for a few seconds, which will be indicated with a sound effect and animation. The total number ofstacks between the two will be added up, divided by two, and redistributed to both players equally, with fractions being rounded down to the nearest whole number. It isnotpossible for a player withoutto acquire the debuff. More simply, there are only five possible combinations:(1 stack) +(1 stack) →(1 stack) +(1 stack)(2 stacks) +(2 stacks) →(2 stacks) +(2 stack)(2 stacks) +(1 stack) →(1 stack) +(1 stack)(1 stack) + no debuff (0 stacks) → no debuff (0 stacks) + no debuff (0 stacks)(2 stacks) + no debuff (0 stacks) →(1 stack) + no debuff (0 stacks)Only "productive" merges (i.e. those that reduce the total number of stacks) should be performed to successfully resolve the mechanic.Players who cleanse their stacks ofwill receive a new debuff,Critical Factor, which will become relevant at the end. Players who did not start with any stacks ofwill not receive this new debuff.Each time two players mix, they will leave behind an untargetableForbidden Factor(black slime) add, which will become relevant later. There will be 6 adds in total, 3 on each side.Stable System: All players initially receive this 10s debuff, preventing them from "mixing" with other players during the start of the mechanic. A shorter duration of this debuff is also given after mixing withUnstable Factor.Pantheos: Gradually spawns a total of 10 two-person towers in a <==> formation:Two towers will first appear to the far left and far right sides, one light and one dark.Afterwards, four towers (two per side) will then appear towards the center, one north of the first one and the other south of the first one. The north tower will always have the opposite color as the first, and the south tower will be the same color.Finally, another four towers (two per side) will appear even closer towards the center, in the same pattern as the second tower set.Each tower must be soaked by one person with the opposite-colorTiltdebuff and one person without anyTiltdebuff. Upon soaking the tower, one random person in the tower will receive the same-colorTiltas the tower, while the previousTiltwill be removed.This mechanic seems complex but the resolution is relatively straightforward:Starting in their conga line, players will identify their debuffs.The two playerswithoutany stacks ofwill take a step forward. The left-most person will go left and the right-most person will go right.The two players with1 stackofwill take a step backward. The left-most person will go left and the right-most person will go right.The remaining four players, who will have2 stacksof, will remain in the middle until the first towers spawn.Once the first towers spawn, the0 stackplayers andshort(16s)players will soak the towers. Theplayers must soak the opposite color tower as their debuff.For the second set of towers:The player pair who soaked the first towers will soak the north towers.The1 stackplayers andlong(20s)players will soak the south towers.After soaking the second set of towers, each player should take note of whether they received a newdebuff from the second towers.If they did not receive a color debuff, they will move horizontally to soak the third tower, which will be the same color.If they received a color debuff, they will move diagonally to soak the third tower, which will be the opposite color.When soaking towers with their partner, players should make sure to stack tightly so they mix and reduce the number ofstacks.After soaking all towers, the party should collapse south, with the initially0 stackplayers towards the front at their initial sides. Each slime add will tether a random player with a transferrable tether. The 0-stack players must each pick up three tethers and move far away from the party, because they will be hit with a massive AoE from each slime (Factor In) that inflicts a stack ofFourfold-come Ruin. Any player with(i.e., they originally hadstacks) will die to these, requiring the 0-stack players to handle them.At the same time, the main tank will be marked for the two-hitPalladian Grasptankbuster, which functions similarly as before. It is strongly recommended to use an invulnerability cooldown for this instead of a tank swap to minimize movement. The players taking the tethers should avoid being too far away from the center (without clipping others) so they do not get hit with this tankbuster if they are not the main tank.The Classical Concepts 2The Classical Concepts: Massive raidwide damage and initially functions similarly asClassical Concepts 1. Players should first locate their shape to block based on their Playstation marker andTargetdebuff.Panta Rhei: The shapes will all disappear and reappear in new locations that is 180 degrees rotated from their original location. Shortly after, the shape tethers will resolve, requiring players to be in the new locations before this cast bar finishes.After players find their initial position, during this slow cast, they should carefully move to their final position considering this rotation. Avoid moving too far from your partner to prevent the green tether from breaking. In a Party Finder context with no voice communication, a common way to indicate to your partner that you are ready to move is by jumping.Palladian Ray: Functions similarly to the first usage, requiring the party to spread to prevent overlap of their conal AoEs while leaving safe spots to dodge.Once the shape tethers appear, it is safe to preposition into spread spots for this mechanic.Unlike the first iteration, the shapes will useImplodeafterthe conal AoEs start going off, compared to before. Players must dodge the lingering conal AoEs into areas that are also safe from the point-blank AoEs from the shapes.Caloric Theory 2UltimaCrush HelmCaloric Theory: Heavy raidwide damage, similar to before, but spawns different debuffs on the party.During the cast bar, players should go to their "q"-spread positions, using the blue grid lines as a guide. One player (preferably a ranged DPS) will go exactly middle, while six others will form a hexagon around them one diagonal grid length apart. The remaining player (prefably another ranged DPS) will occupy the southeast position. Each player should stand exactly on the intersection of grid lines.7 random players will receive a green marker and the remaining player will receive a red marker.The red marker player, if they are not already middle, will swap places with the green marked player in the center.After the cast resolves, each player will emit a medium-sized AoE around them that required them to be spread. The following debuffs will also be assigned:All players will receiveAtmosfaction, functioning similarly as before.Each green marked player will receivetwo stacksofClose Caloricand the singular red marked player receivesthree stacksofClose Caloric.One random player will receiveeight stacksofEntropification. The number of stacks will gradually decrease, each time dropping a large circular AoE (Entropic Excess) over the player's current location. This debuff can be exchanged to another player on contact, which will also transfer the current number of stacks. The previous player will receiveEntropy Resistance, preventing them from acquiringagain. The player withwill be denoted with a fiery overhead marker.The goal of the mechanic is to passbetween each player (except for the middle player) to prevent excess movement from dodging the periodicEntropic ExcessAoEs. This will prevent players from obtaining 5 stacks ofand wiping the raid.The first player withwill rotate clockwise to pass the debuff to the next player in the q-spread. After they drop their AoE, the original player will move outwards, while the new player with the debuff will pass to the next.The player in the middle can remain in the center for the entirety of the mechanic.Each player must be sufficiently spread to prevent clipping anyone withDynamic Atmosphere, which resolves at the end.With the exception of the middle player (who will not receive more stacks), all players should have 4 stacks ofby the end. Players are not allowed to move more than 18 yalms (~2 diagonal grid rectangle lengths) or they will receive 5 stacks and wipe the raid.Ekpyrosis: Functions similarly as before, with a random AoE pattern. Mitigate and heal as needed.Gaiaochos 2 ("UAV 2")Gaiaochos: Heavy raidwide damage and functions similarly as before, shrinking the arena into a small circle and giving everyoneAscended.Summon Darkness: Spawns one untargetableHemitheosadd on a random intercardinal.Demi Parhelion: Spawns the 3x3 circle AoE telegraphs as before. However, this will also be coupled with the chain markers andMissing Link.The boss's tentacles will telegraph either vertical or horizontal safe spots from the propagating AoEs.Players must remain stacked centeruntilappears, or they will not be able to break the chains.Once the debuffs appear, the party will split to break the chains, moving perpendicular to theHemitheos.Geocentrism: The line AoE from the add and propagating AoEs will resolve. Each player will be marked with an orange marker forDivine Excoriation, so players must spread in the narrow safe spots after the line AoE resolves.Summon Darkness: Summons fourHemitheosadds on random cardinals and intercardinals.Either all supports or all DPS will each be tethered to one add. They will also be inflicted withMagic Vulnerability Up.The tethered players must move to the wall opposite their add to prevent overlap. Meanwhile, their opposite role partner must stand slightly inwards between them and the add to prevent the laser (Ultima Blow) from killing the tethered players due to the vulnerability debuff. The blocking players must not stand too inwards, or they will be hit with more than one laser and die.Because players are tethered to random adds, it is recommended for each player tofocus targettheir partner, which should be the same as in Phase 1.It is possible for a tank to stand directly in the middle and use an invulnerability cooldown.UltimaSummon Darkness: This attack repeats, except the other role group will now be tethered. The players who were originally tethered must now block for their partners.UltimaIgnorabimus (enrage): The boss must be defeated before this slow cast finishes, or it will destroy the platform and wipe the party.Loot30Allagan Tomestone of Comedy1Anabaseios Mythos IV(Guaranteed)1Athena Card(Drops at a fixed rate.)Treasure CofferOne randomAscension Weaponwill appear.NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAscension Weapon Coffer (IL 665)OtherN/AABasic1Paladin's Ascension Arms (IL 665)OtherN/ACBlue1Bardiche of AscensionMarauder's Arm665CBlue1Greatsword of AscensionDark Knight's Arm665CBlue1Bayonet of AscensionGunbreaker's Arm665CBlue1Trident of AscensionLancer's Arm665CBlue1War Scythe of AscensionReaper's Arm665CBlue1Knuckles of AscensionPugilist's Arm665CBlue1Samurai Blade of AscensionSamurai's Arm665CBlue1Knives of AscensionRogue's Arm665CBlue1Harp Bow of AscensionArcher's Arm665CBlue1Knifelock of AscensionMachinist's Arm665CBlue1War Quoits of AscensionDancer's Arm665CBlue1Rod of AscensionTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm665CBlue1Grimoire of AscensionArcanist's Grimoire665CBlue1Foil of AscensionRed Mage's Arm665CBlue1Cane of AscensionTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm665CBlue1Codex of AscensionScholar's Arm665CBlue1Planisphere of AscensionAstrologian's Arm665CBlue1Wings of AscensionSage's Arm665CBlue1Wind-up AthenaMinionN/AABasic1Ultima's Perfection (Endwalker) Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Megaloambystoma HornOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchApotheosis Agria I5Complete Pandæmonium: Anabaseios (Savage).-6.4Apotheosis Agria II10Complete Pandæmonium: Anabaseios (Savage) 5 times.-6.4Apotheosis Agria III20Complete Pandæmonium: Anabaseios (Savage) 10 times.-6.4DialogueAll lines from the boss are voice acted.Phase 1:Athena:Show me your all, that I might become divinity manifest!(upon pull)Athena:From nothing, I mold life!(Paradeigma)Athena:You cannot escape my eternal gaze!(Trinity of Souls)Athena:These chains are forged from the fabric of creation!(Superchain Theory I)Athena:Today, my theory shall be proven fact!(Peridialogos/Apodialogos)Athena:To silent vessels, I give voice!(Unnatural Enchainment)Athena:This is but a glimpse of a god's strength!(arena transition and Ultima Blade)Athena:Behold such power as you will never wield!(Palladion)Athena:From the deepest pit of the seven hells to the pinnacle of the heavens, the world shall tremble!(Theos's Ultima and enrage)Athena:Such a singularly resolute soul...(after Theos's Ultima)Athena:Miscalculations are inevitable...but vexing.(Superchain Theory IIB)Athena:Shine brilliant for me!(Parthenos)Athena:What arrogance to defy a god!(final On the Soul)Cutscene:Athena:Could my theories have been flawed...?Athena:Although I wished so ardently...Athena:But perhaps...with the Heart of Sabik!???:Yes...The flaws are not mine...???:This misbegotten world is to blame...Pallas Athena:Only the hands of a god can fix it—my hands!Phase 2:Pallas Athena:I can create worlds—or unmake them!(upon pull)Pallas Athena:I will not be denied!(Palladian Grasp)Pallas Athena:Only I can guide this star to its rightful place!(Gaiaochos)Pallas Athena:Denizens of the abyss!

Regardless, the mechanic is often called "UAV" (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) by players, referring to a highly zoomed-out perspective of the ground from an aircraft.RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
