Strategy

Lady of the Vortex: Garuda

Phase 1

- Tank should pull Garuda to 1 edge of the boss room, away from the stone pillars. 
- Ranged damage dealers and healers should spread out to minimize damage from Friction.
- Slipstream can be dodged despite not having an indicator.
- Do not let Garuda damage the stone pillars with Friction and Wicked Wheel.
- At 3/4 HP, Garuda will disappear and cast Mistral Song. Hide behind stone pillars immediately to avoid being killed.
- After Mistral Song, Garuda will spawn Razor Plume adds. Pull DPS off Garuda to kill the adds with AoE abilities.
- At 1/2 HP, Garuda will disappear and use Mistral Song again from the other side. More Razor Plume adds will spawn scattered around the room. Focus fire them down one by one.
- Garuda will then vanish and reappear in the center to use Aerial Blast. Damage depends on remaining stone pillars. Tanks can use Limit Break to reduce damage. Phase 2 begins after Aerial Blast.
