In this fight, all players are granted theOmega Jammerability, which is used to deal with two specific situations. When used, an electrical AoE will surge over the target and anything else around it.Opening PhaseAtomic Ray- inflicts unavoidable raid-wide damage.Mustard Bomb- a vicious tankbuster against Omega's primary target that deals damage in a very small area. Tanks should make sure that non-tank players are not stacked on top of them during the blast.Ballistic Impact- marks all eight players with AoE circles, forcing them to spread apart to avoid overlapping damage. On detonation, the circles leave behind persistent puddles of fire that inflict a strong and non-dispellableBurnsdebuff on anyone who remains within the fire for too long. Bear in mind thatBallistic Impactwill happen at the same time asFlame Thrower.Flame Thrower- spawns eight evenly-distanced cone attacks that fan out from Omega's position, leaving similarly shaped safe-spots in-between each cone. Due to being executed at the same time asBallistic Impact, all players will have very limited space to maneuver.Wave Cannon- comes in two variations -Larboard Wave CannonandStarboard Wave Cannon. Larboard shoots from Omega'sleftside, while Starboard does the same for itsrightside. Getting hit will deal very high damage and inflictVulnerability Up. After using a Wave Cannon attack, Omega will spin around to face the opposite direction and use a second Wave Cannon attack in an attempt to confuse players. If you find yourself being tricked, it helps to remember a simple note: "Larboard" equalsLeft. If it's not Larboard, it's to Omega's right.Alternatively, it may be helpful to think of the attack name as telling the player the safe side. If it's Larboard, the player can move totheirleft to be safe (since the attack will hit Omega's Left). This only works if Omega is facing the player, as he usually is for the main tank.In either case, it is important to know which way Omega is facing and pay attention to any swaps he does.Peripheral Synthesis- creates a wall ofRocket Punchadds that will appear on one edge of the arena and slowly travel across it, inflicting very high damage, knock-back, and a stackableVulnerability Updebuff to anyone they collide with. While these can be targeted, they have too much health to burn down in the usual fashion. Instead, players must utilize theirOmega Jammer(Duty Action) to deal roughly half of its max health in damage. Omega telegraphs this attack by shouting "<blip> Reconstructing rocket-propelled armament."At this point, Omega will use anotherFlame Thrower(patterned AoE blast) andAtomic Ray(unavoidable raid-wide AoE), followed by a mechanical loop if Omega still has plenty of health remaining. However, if sufficiently damaged, Omega will fly away from the arena and the next phase begins.Add PhaseAfter reaching roughly 70% health, Omega will exit the arena, leaving behind electro-puddles in the center and outer edges of the arena that will instantly kill anyone standing in it when it finishes forming, or at any point afterwards.Once the arena has been augmented, aLevel Checkerwill spawn in the center AoE and begin to cast variousExecutables. Each cast of Executable inflicts the entire party with theLooperdebuff, which changes intoMemory Lossif its timer counts down to 0. Characters under the Memory Loss debuff will walk around randomly, nearly guaranteeing that the character will enter the blue puddles and die.Executable #1- spawns eight Particle Beam-style circles around the arena - one for each player to stand in. Standing inside the circle as its ability casts will dispel the Looper debuff from that player and deal minor damage withStorage Violation. If a circle is not occupied by the time its ability is fired, the whole party is hit withCritical Storage Violationfor higher damage and a stack of aDamage Downdebuff, making the DPS check harder.Executable #2- spawns a point-blank AoE centered on the Level Checker followed by four Particle Beam circles inside the first AoE, along with a ring AoE on the outside of the arena where the first did not hit. To avoid, all players will need to run away from the Level Checker to avoid the point-blank, then run towards it to dodge the outer-blast, giving everyone enough space to get inside the circles (two players each) to dispel their Looper debuffs.After using Executable twice, the Level Checker will begin to long-castForce Quit- a DPS check that results in a raid-wipe if the Level Checker is not slain in time. Once the Level Checker is destroyed, the blue AoE on the platform will vanish and Omega will reappear off the north side of the arena to begin charging upDelta Attack.Delta Attack PhaseAs soon asDelta Attackbegins to charge, an alliedConductive Focuswill spawn in the center of the arena. All players will need to target this add and use their Omega Jammer (Duty Action) on it to build up theElectromagnetic Inductionmeter. Once the meter reaches 100%, a shield will form around the center of the arena, greatly reducing the damage dealt by Delta Attack. Failing to do this in time will result in Delta Attack wiping the entire raid.Final PhaseAfter using Delta Attack, Omega will return to the arena and use the attacks from its first phase, but with a few new additions and changes.(Improved)Peripheral Synthesis- will spawn 1-2 giant versions of the previousRocket Punchadds at the edge(s) of the arena. After a moderate delay, these adds will launch across the platform in a straight line and devastate anyone caught in their path.Electric Slide- creates a stack-marker on a random player. After a brief delay, Omega launches itself into the targeted player's location, inflicting shareable damage. All players must stack on the selected player to save them from a grisly fate.(Improved)Mustard Bomb- causes every second cast ofMustard Bombto tether itself to a random player. After the tetheredMustard Bombis executed, Omega will hit the tethered player with a devastating area of effect blast that deals extremely high damage and inflictsParalysison everyone within range of the blast. As a result, the off-tank should grab the tether and move away from the group as soon as possible.From here, Omega will begin to cycle through previously experienced mechanics in various combos until Omega has been defeated, or the raid wipes. Mechanical combinations include:Starboard and/or LarboardWave Cannons(left or right beams),Atomic Ray(unavoidable raid-wide damage), both versions ofPeripheral Synthesissimultaneously (i.e. slow-moving walls of small Rocket Punch adds and the huge straight-line charging fists at the same time),Electric Slidestack-markers, and more - but nothing you haven't witnessed already.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAlphascape LensOtherN/AABasic1Alphascape ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Alphascape SpringOtherN/AABasic1Alphascape BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAlphascape ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Alphascape CrankOtherN/AABasic1Alphascape SpringOtherN/AABasic1Alphascape BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 3NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityeScape Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1DialogueOmega: You are the Alpha, I am theOmega. <blip> Initiating direct analysis of subject group.
