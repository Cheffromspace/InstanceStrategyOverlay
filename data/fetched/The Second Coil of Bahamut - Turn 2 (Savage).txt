The one that spawns closest to the healers need to be stoned ASAP. The other one can be kited while avoiding shriek. Renauds that spawn after the first voice expires should be stoned. Destroy one and wait for the renauds that spawn after the second voice before destroying the other. Renauds that spawn before or during the first voice are to be stoned and destroyed.Phase 1:Watch out for petrifaction at the start, have your summoner kite the 2 renauds that spawn to the south side where healers can stone them. The first set of renauds are killed. When it's close to 80%, wait for a voice (presumably the first voice in the rotation) before phasing it. This ensures that renauds will spawn along with a second voice to stone them for the shriek. Adds need to be killed ASAP as they hit extremely hard.Phase 2:Before 65%, wait for a shriek to occur to reset the cycle, so that you have the entire rotation of 2 x Cursed Voice to kill at least 2 fatedealers. Venomous tails need to be removed ASAP.Phase 3:Kill fatedealers, right before 50%, wait for the first shriek to reset the cycle before phasing melusine.Phase 4:Prosector is up, watch for double petrifaction. DPS it but wait for a shriek before killing it. This resets the cycle so you don't get a fast double shriek. When double shriek occurs, assign another kiter to drag the other renaud in a such a way that both renauds are positioned opposite each other. In this phase, with regards to the voice-renaud-shriek cycle, the frequency of the voices is increased. Any renauds that spawn are to kited and stoned for double shrieks. When dragged into position, these renauds should be stoned in a way that they do not face the middle. Petrifaction from the boss can put a wrench in the cycle so play it by ear. If you see renauds that spawn before the first voice occurs, they can be dragged into position to avoid them facing the middle when they get the second voice debuff.If they spawn after the first voice and before it expires, do the same thing. If they spawn after the first voice expires, chances are they'll be petrified where they spawn. In this instance, it becomes a matter of rng, as you'll need to pray that the circular puddles spawn before the shrieks. If the renauds are in a good position (opposite each other), it's fine. If they're not, you'll need to sacrifice one of the shrieked people in the puddle, and adapt to the position of the other shriek. During double shrieks, do a tank swap.To simplify:Renauds that spawn before first voice/during the first voice = Position and stone them with first voice. They'll get the second voice debuff. Don't stand in front of them. Shrieked members wait for the voice on the renauds to go off before moving to the renaudsRenauds that spawn after the first voice and before a petrifaction = If badly positioned, kill one, sacrifice one shriek in the puddle. Watch for renaud with second voice debuff.Renauds that spawn after the first voice and the petrifaction that follows = Position them and stone them with second voice, perform double shriek maneuver.Venomous tails are to be removed. Assign an order among your white mages and scholars.There is an enrage timer of 11 mins.LootMelusine20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityHigh Allagan Aetherstone - Hand GearMaterialN/AABasic1High Allagan Aetherstone - Leg GearMaterialN/AABasic1High Allagan Head Gear Coffer (IL 110)OtherN/AABasic1High Allagan Hand Gear Coffer (IL 110)OtherN/AABasic1High Allagan Foot Gear Coffer (IL 110)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityHigh Allagan Head Gear Coffer (IL 110)OtherN/AABasic1High Allagan Hand Gear Coffer (IL 110)OtherN/AABasic1High Allagan Foot Gear Coffer (IL 110)OtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchSeconds10DefeatMelusinewithin thesecond turnofthe Second Coil of Bahamut (Savage).Melusine Mauler2.3RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
