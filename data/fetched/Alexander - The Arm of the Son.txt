Not all is well, however, as Wedge informs you of Roundrox's capture by the Illuminati. Your objective is now clear─press further into Midas, and rescue the innocent goblin from her captors!— In-game descriptionAlexander - The Arm of the Sonis a level 60raidintroduced inpatch 3.2withHeavensward.

These debuffs cannot be cured withEsuna, but will go away as soon as you step back out of them, so just don't stand in them if you can avoid it.When marked with a purple marker, stay away from other players. The boss will turn to you and shoot a big beam AoE calledSizzlebeamyour way, which hits anything in a straight line in front of the boss and inflicts anElectrocutionDoT that cannot be cured withEsuna.The boss has a huge AoE attack he uses from time to time. While it does not have a cast-bar, it does have ground markers. Getting hit by these will drain you of 1500 MP and inflict a stackingBleedingDoT, which lasts a minute and cannot be cured withEsuna. Simply walk out of this.The boss has an attack calledUplander Doom, which is a sort of tankbuster. It will hit multiple times (with a minimum of four times and progressively more often as the fight continues) and inflict a stackingPhysical Vulnerability Upon the Tank. This debuff lasts a minute and cannot be cured withEsuna. Either simply heal through this or do a Tank-Switch if your Tanks/Healers have bad gear.At intervals, the boss will place a target on one player and fly up in the air. The boss will fly towards the marked player, stun them, then grab them and send them to a cage in one of the four corners of the room. Stay away from the marked person, as both the stun and the grab can affect multiple people. Keep in mind that while you are inside the cage, you cannot be targeted by other players, so you cannot be healed. Once the mechanic of each cage has resolved, the walls are removed and you can rejoin the fray.When you are sent to thered cage, you are inflicted withPyretic, which inflicts damage every time you move or use actions. Stand still and do not use any actions whatsoever while the others break the Padlock add from outside and free you.This usually targets a DPS.When you are sent to thepurple cage, you will be afflicted with aThrottle, aDoom-Type debuff, and must kill anAlarumadd before it runs out. Failure to kill the add in time results in immediate death.This usually targets a DPS, but is often skipped due to high damage output.When you are sent to thewhite cage, you get afflicted with a non-removableFrostbiteDoT and must fight aGobwalkeradd. Touching the cage walls will causeDeep Freezefor a few seconds, preventing any actions and movement. Try to keep the add directly between you and a wall, as the add has a knockback attack designed to push you into the walls.This usually targets the off-tank.When you are sent to thegreen cage, you will see a gas vent emitting noxious gas. Standing in this gas vent applies a non-removablePoisonDoT to you, but not standing on it will apply this DoT to EVERYONE in the boss room. Simply stand on the vent so the others don't get poisoned and wait it out.This usually targets a Healer.During the cage mechanics,Panzer-DollandSturm-Dolladds will spawn in the center platform. Kill these adds quickly, as they will self-destruct if they live long enough, inflicting massive raid-wide damage. In addition, theSturm-Dollhas an attack called 'Kugelblitz'. This inflicts medium raid-wide damage, but can be interrupted with aStun.After a short while, the spikes in the room will retract into the floor. At this point,Shanoa(the small black cat) will enter the arena.Shanoacannot be targeted or attacked in any way. She instead will run around the arena randomly, spawning an add calledTrue Heartfrom time to time that will slowly hover towards the boss.If the True Heart reaches the boss, the boss will receive a massive heal and gain a stacking buff which greatly increases his damage output.DPSs should focus theTrue Heartimmediately while the Main-Tank tries to keep the boss away from it.During theTrue Heartmechanic, a huge steel ball calledWeight of the Worldwill fall into the arena. As withShanoa,Weight of the Worldcannot be targeted or attacked, and will instead roll around the room. TouchingWeight of the Worldwill result in 9999 damage and a knockback. Stay away from it.If damage output is low, you may see aBombdrop down that will tether to a player and follow it. The tethered player should drag the bomb to one of the corners of the room where the explosion can only hit the tethered player in order to minimize damage.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Midan LensOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan SpringOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Midan ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan CrankOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan SpringOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Midan BoltOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Midas III10Discover every location withinAlexander: Midas - the Arm of the Son.-3.2RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
