Sometimes you have to float and sometimes you have to stay on the ground. To float, use the Duty Action, which costs an oGCD.Before starting, assign each tank/healer and each DPS with a main cardinal direction, N/E/S/W. One tank/healer and one DPS should be at each main cardinal direction.Catastrophe enrages at 10:45, with a raid DPS requirement of at least ~20500.AntilightThe main mechanic in the fight. Catastrophe summons large spheres that cover a large portion of the arena. Blue spheres are on the ground and Yellow spheres are in the air. Stand in the safe spot to avoid probably dying.Antilight YellowFloating players are not safe. Do not float until a ground mechanic resolves in order to dodge this.Antilight Blue and YellowThe middle will be safe, whether you are floating or not.For the very first one, only being on the ground in the middle is safe.TremblorA small raidwide AoE, and indicates that Earthquake is about to come. Happens twice.EarthquakeInstantly kills anyone on the ground when the castbar resolves.100GsTwo blue circles spawn on players with #1 enmity and #2 enmity. Players standing in these circles will be forced to the ground. Always stack to ensure everyone safely makes it to the ground.Gravitational WaveA magical raid buster AoE that does lots of damage. Mitigate as necessary.Gravitational ManipulationCatastrophe forces one tank/healer and one DPS to either float or be on the ground, then puts a stack marker AoE around them both (Fourfold Sacrifice). Four players including the marked player must be in each stack. Failure to do so will do heavy AoE damage and apply a vuln stack.Assign tanks/healers OR DPS to float. This will always satisfy the Fourfold Sacrifice's condition. We had DPS always float.Aetherial RiftInflicts the 6 Fulms Under debuff to anyone standing on the ground. If the debuff resolves, it instantly kills the player. Float to get rid of the debuff.Paranormal WaveA cleave directed towards the MT. Inflicts a stacking debuff called Gradual Petrification. If a player has three stacks, it will petrify them and likely instantly kill them. There will always be three in a row, and an Evilsphere after the second cleave.Tank swap after the second cleave to ensure the MT does not die from the third cleave. The MT should move to the side afterwards to avoid getting cleaved. We have the OT provoke during Evilsphere.EvilsphereA high damage magical tank buster. Mitigate as necessary.Maniacal ProbeMarks tanks/healers or DPS with tentacle spawns. The marked players must bring their tentacles to their assigned positions. These tentacles, after Epicenter casts, will indicate where Earthquakes will spawn from. Deals slight damage to the marked players.EpicenterThe tentacles begin to react to where the Earthquakes are. The very edge of the arena where the first tentacle to stop glowing will be safe.Death's GazeA standard gaze type attack that will kill anyone looking at the boss when the cast bar resolves.-100GsCatastrophe summons three Antilight Blue and Yellows across the centre of the arena. The very North and South is safe. Additionally, he marks a few players with an AoE - be careful not to overlap these. When the cast bar resolves, all players will be flung into the air.Stand in the very North and South of the arena, and spread out in that small space to avoid overlapping AoE markers.Unstable GravityMarks four players with the Unstable Gravity debuff. When this resolves, it emits a large AoE damaging all players hit.Long DropAn AoE stack marker that knocks anyone floating back from the center of the stack. Players on the ground are not knocked back. Deals heavy damage to all players hit.Unstable Gravity goes off a few seconds after Long Drop. Have the players marked with Unstable Gravity get knocked back to their assigned positions once the Antilight Blue and Yellow resolves.Alternatively, you can have the players marked with Unstable Gravity move right after the Antilight Blue and Yellow resolves to their assigned positions, and heavily mitigate the Long Drop with Feint, Shields, Reprisal, etc. I do not recommend this but it does work, and has about the same uptime.FightPhase 1Tremblor x2Earthquake100 GsAntilight Blue and YellowGravitational WaveGravitational ManipulationAetherial RiftParanormal WaveParanormal WaveEvilsphereParanormal WavePhase 2Maniacal Probe Tanks/HealersDeath's GazeEpicenterGravitational Wave100 GsGravitational WaveParanormal WaveGravitational ManipulationParanormal WaveEvilsphereParanormal Wave-100 GsDeath's Gaze100 GsAntilight Blue and Yellow + Unstable Gravity Tanks/HealersLong Drop100 GsAntilight YellowTremblor x2Earthquake100 GsPhase 3Maniacal Probe DPSDeath's GazeEpicenterGravitational ManipulationAntilight Blue and Yellow + Unstable Gravity DPSLong DropParanormal WaveParanormal WaveEvilsphereParanormal WaveAntilight Yellow100 GsPhase 4Maniacal Probe Tanks/HealersDeath's GazeEpicenterGravitational ManipulationAntilight Blue and Yellow + Unstable Gravity Tanks/HealersLong DropDeath's GazeAetherial RiftGravitational WaveParanormal WaveAntilight Yellow100 GsParanormal WaveEvilsphereParanormal WaveGravitational ManipulationAetherial RiftAntilight Yellow100 GsTremblor x2EarthquakeGravitational Wave-100 GsDeath's GazeAntilight Yellow100 GsTremblor x2EarthquakeGravitational Wave EnrageEnrage is a long Gravitational Wave cast that ends at around ~10:45.Loot15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsDeltascape Datalog v2.0Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityGenji Kabuto Coffer (IL 340)OtherN/AABasic1Genji Kote Coffer (IL 340)OtherN/AABasic1Genji Sune-ate Coffer (IL 340)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityGenji Kabuto Coffer (IL 340)OtherN/AABasic1Genji Kote Coffer (IL 340)OtherN/AABasic1Genji Sune-ate Coffer (IL 340)OtherN/AABasic1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
