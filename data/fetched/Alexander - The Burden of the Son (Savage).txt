The mechanics must be done as close to perfectly as possible as making even one mistake can result in a wipe.Before the fight, players should split into two light parties consisting of a tank, a healer and two DPS. Players should also place a marker to note where to pass a debuff later in the fight.Phase 1Hydrothermal Missile: Targets the main tank and has splash damage. Players should avoid standing near the tank when this goes off. This attack will fire periodically through the fight.Seed of the Sky: Targets random players with ground AoEs. Simply step out to avoid them.Megabeam: The boss will turn towards a random player and begin charging, then fire. Players need to avoid this, or they will die. There is no cast bar for this attack, so players need to watch for the boss to turn and begin the charging animation.Execution: Four black squares will spawn on the arena, within each will spawn either aSteam Regulator AorSteam Regulator B. These ads will explode after roughly 20 seconds if not dealt with. Once a player enters the square, they can not exit until the ad is dead, or it will explode and wipe the raid. DPS players should be the ones to take care of these enemies. When entering the black square, the player is buffed withDirect Attack, meaning they can only attack their ad. The boss will castSeed of the SkyandMegabeamduring this time. Players can bait the seeds in the corners of their black square and dodge theMegabeamthis way if they are targeted.Perpetual Ray: A heavy-hitting tank buster that debuffs withVulnerability Updebuff, then hits the tank four times withPerpetual Ray. With the debuff, the main tank won't survive this, so a tankswap during the cast is required. This is followed up by anotherMegabeam.Legislation: Each DPS and one healer is tethered to an orb and the DPS are given stacks ofFinal Punishmentbetween 1-4. The orbs will slowly move towards the tethered players and will kill them if it reaches them. Touching the orbs will also spawn an AoE on the ground. Sharing this AoE with people will deal more damage.At this point the boss will also be on the lookout forIllegal Operations.Illegal Operationsconsist of:Dying with a stack ofFinal Punishment.Allowing stacks to expire without removing them.Pushing the boss into the next phase while players still have stacks.If any of theseIllegal Operationscome to pass, the boss will wipe the raid.
Players can remove stacks ofFinal Punishmentby taking damage in any form. This mechanic requires players to take damage and plan how they are going to do so to keep stress off the healers.
The most common strategy is to first number players based on the number of punishment stacks they have, then for the DPS to stack with the main tank and take splash damage fromHydrothermal Missileto remove one stack from everyone. The player that started with 3 stacks will pop the orb on the player with the fourth. Then the player that started with 4 stacks will then pop the rest of the bubbles, removing the rest of their stacks. This will leave two players with one remaining stack. 
The boss will, during this time, castSeed of the Sky.Megabeam, andPerpetual Ray, so handle mechanics as needed. The boss will then castHydrothermal Missile, which the debuffed DPS will share. This will remove the final stack from both of them. Players then need to push the boss to 1% while attacks continue, at which time the boss will take off away from the arena.Phase 2In this phase, the 4 robots from The Cuff of the Son Savage appear at set intervals. They will use the same mechanics from their fight. If all 4 of the robots are in the arena at one time, they will explode, and the party will wipe.
The bosses will use their signature mechanics at exactly 50%, so players need to be careful not to push multiple robots to this point, as it may result in a wipe. 
At the start of the phase,BlasterandBrawlerwill spawn, withBrawlerunable to move from the center, but still able to attack at range. Players should focus on getting rid ofBlasterfirst. Move him to the east of the arena and away from the center, asBrawlerwill castAuxiliary Power, buffing any robot that stands in the AoE.
At 50%,Blasterwill summon a mirage that will tether toBlasterif it gets too close and render him invincible. The off tank should provoke this and pull it away, over toBrawler.Blaster will also castMindblast, so be sure to interrupt him, or it is a wipe.Around this point,Swindlerwill drop down and the tank holdingBlasterwill also grab this robot as well.Swindlerwill introduce the height mechanics from its fight, so avoid accordingly.
Players should haveBlasterdefeated by this point. When he is defeated, the Mirage will disappear as well.At 50%,Brawlerwill become invincible and summonBeta OrbsandGamma Orbs. These work the same way as inBrawlersfight, so stun one of the Beta orbs so they don't hit the boss at the same time and pop the Gamma orbs.
At 50%,Swindler'will castBioarithmetics, dealing high raid-wide damage to be healed through.
Around this point,Vortexerwill drop in the arena. He should be picked up by either tank. Focus on burning downBrawler, then focus onVortexerand get it to around 50%.
At this point, both robots should be brought to around 50%-60%, but don't kill one before the other. If one dies before the other, the survivor will castSelf-Destruct. If this cast goes off, the party will wipe.
Keep the robots separate as you burn them down, asSwindlercan also castAuxiliary Powerand buffVortexer.
At 50%,Vortexerwill castSuper Cyclone, dealing damage and knockback to all players.Swindlerwill also castEneumerationon the tank at this time, requiring players to stack according to the orbs in the circle.Vortexerwill castElemental Jammer, Debuffing a player withCompressed Lightning. Handle this mechanic as before. When it comes time to pass the debuff, meet at the predetermined marker. Players will have to continue to pass the debuff around until the bosses are defeated.
Continue burning the bosses down evenly until one is defeated, then quickly burn the last one before it can explode.Phase 3At this phase,Brute Justicewill form, dealing raid-wide damage. The main tank should pull the boss to the center.Flarethrower: The boss will cast a conal AoE of fire, move away from the front of the boss to avoid this.Double Rocket Punch: A heavy-hitting tank buster. This needs to be split by both tanks to mitigate. If the attack is split, the damage is split between both tanks. If more than 2 players split the attack, the damage is split in half, but applied to each person hit. If anyone dies to this attack, the boss gets a permanentDamage Upbuff.Short Needle: Unavoidable raid-wide damage.Seed of the Sky: Random players are targeted for ground AoEs.Prey Markers: Targeted players will be hit byLong Needle. These players need to move away from the party and separate to avoid overlapping damage.Long Needle: A player will be marked with a stack marker, and players must stand together to mitigate the damage.To handle these mechanics coming out one after the other, players are recommended to stack on the flank of the boss to bait theSeed of the Sky, move out of the AoEs and separate/stack as needed for the followingLong Needlemarkers.Super Jump: The boss will target the player furthest away and jump to them. The off tank should bait this attack to the west wall with the party gathered in the boss's hitbox.Apocalypse: The boss turns to a random player and unleashes this attack in front of them. Players need to move behind the boss to avoid. Getting hit by this deals heavy damage and adds aVulnerability Upstack.The boss will follow this up withFlarethrower,Double Rocket Punch, and anotherFlarethrower. The boss will then repeat its attacks fromShort NeedletoSuper Jump. Payers need to deal as much damage to the boss as possible in this time. The boss will leave the arena at this time.Phase 4This phase consists of dodging mechanics. Dying here will buff the boss permanently withDamage Up.J Kick: High raid-wide damage. Mitigate and heal through.100 Megatonze Shock: Raid-wide proximity damage. Move away to the wall and group up at the center of the wall for the next mechanic.Mirages: 4 players are targeted by Mirages who will charge where the markers drop. Marked players should spread out along the wall to drop their markers and move back to the center of the wall to avoid.Double Buster: Targets a tank. The party needs to stack on the tank to mitigate the damage.Steam Chakrams: These spawn at the edge of the arena, two per adjacent wall, leaving safe spaces between them. Stand in these safe zones to avoid damage. AMegabeamwill fire before the Chakrams do.Earth/Ice Missiles: Ice missiles target random players, leaving growing AoEs behind. Drop these near the edge to avoid them. Earth missiles drop puddles, bait them against the wall as well. Players will then deal with a height mechanic.Phase 5This phase is an exact repeat of phase 3, except the attacks hit harder. Simply bring the boss to 0% HP and the boss will leave the arena again.Phase 6This phase requires players dodging more mechanics. Players should stack in the south of the room for the first mechanic,J Kick. Simply heal through this.Onslaughterwill drop in and deal raid-wide proximity damage. Move away and heal through.Brawlerwill spawn in the north and useDouble Drilland summon mines, two red and two blue. The red mines will stay visible, but the blue ones will dissapear. The drills will drop on the closest and furthest players, which the tanks should bait out, then move to blow up the blue mines after that. The boss will fire aMegabeamafter this, so players should dodge to the south. More Mirages will spawn but can be dealt with the same way as last time. Steam Chakrams will also spawn around the arena and fire again. Handle these the same as last time.Ultra Flash: The boss will begin to charge this attack. Players will need to stand behind the legs of the Onslaughter to break the line of sight between them and the boss. Eneumeration Circles will spawn at this point, and only the correct number of players can stand in the circles. Have players with the circles stand directly in front of the legs, while the players stand further back but still behind them.Phase 7In this final phase, players will need to handle several mechanics that, if done incorrectly, will cause a death or even a wipe.Verdict: Players will be inflicted with bothFinal JudgmentandFinal Punishment. Several orbs and 4 J Storms will spawn, the latter lowering the HP of players who touch them to single digits, and the orbs will simply stay in place, as well as 2 zones with aSteam Regulator A & B. Players will need to satisfy the requirement of their debuffs before the boss usesGavel. Let’s take a look at the debuffs that each player is inflicted with:Tanks will be inflicted withFinal Judgment: Max/Min HPand 3-4 stacks ofFinal Punishmentrespectively. Tanks need to removeFinal Punishmentvia the boss's auto-attacks, so simply take enough attacks to remove your stacks, then tankswap. The tank with theMax HPmust simply have max HP, where theMin HPtank needs to have the lowest HP on the party.Healers will be inflicted withFinal Judgment: Penalty 1 or 2and 3 stacks of Punishment if they have Penalty 1, or 1 Stack if they have Penalty 2. Players will need to have stacks of debuffs in accordance with their penalty.DPS players will be inflicted withFinal Judgment: Nisi A or Band 1 Punishment stack, orFinal Judgment: Penalty 3with 2 Punishment stacks. Players with Nisi A or B need to kill their respective ad, while Penalty 3 players need to reach 3 debuffs.To handle all these mechanics, Players need to be hit by several attacks together. Players withPenalty 1will pop the orb to the south, then split the 2 north orbs with theNisidebuffed players after they defeat their ads. The other southern orb is for players withPenalty 3. ThePenalty 2player will take the northwest Jstorm, while theMin HPtank will take the other storm during the gavel cast to assure they have the lowest HP. Finally, when the boss castsGavel, players will pop the final orb and receive their debuffs. The boss will rise into the air and drop down with aJ Kickthat needs to be healed through.Link-Up: A DPS will haveCompressed Watercast on them.Final Punch: A tankbuster that stuns and knocks the main tank back followed byFinal Apocalypse, dealing high damage, andFinal Beam, which needs to be split amongst the party. The main tank needs to use heavy cooldowns before they're stunned. The off tank can turn the boss away forFinal Apocalypse, then turn back forFinal Beam.Blue mines will also spawn on one of the four middle platforms, aLong Needlemarker comes out,Seed of the Skywill place AoEs on the ground, and aPreymarker will come out as well. Players should stack to bait the Seed AoEs, Prey targets should spread out from the party, while the rest of the party should stack for theLong Needle. All players should make sure to avoid the panel with the invisible Blue Mine.All of these mechanics, on top of theCompressed Watermechanics that will soon come out, can be a lot for players to deal with. To add to things, the boss will also summonEnumerationcircles that will require players to stack appropriately. The most common strategy is to have the Water debuffed player to simply step into the blue mine, sacrificing themselves. The Water debuff will not explode and wipe the party if the player is killed this way. This makes the arena safer to move around on and completely skips mechanics, then the player can simply be revived.Steam Chakrams will spawn afterLong Needle, so pull the boss to the safe zone between them. The boss will follow up with anotherEnumeration, then aMegabeam.While these mechanics are firing, have the main tank step away to bait aSuper Jumpfrom the boss. The boss will then follow up with aFlarethrowerand anotherFinal Punchset of mechanics. It is recommended that tanks use an invulnerability skill here to help take some pressure off the healers.
The boss will fly away and useJ Kickso players should be ready to mitigate and heal through, especially given a player has aWeaknessdebuff.The boss will catch fire, begin spinning, and pulsing outJ Waveevery 5 seconds, with each hit dealing more and more damage. This signifies the boss's enrage, so players need to defeat the boss before it defeats them.LootSee also:Midan WeaponsMidan Manifesto - Page 4(Guaranteed)Faust Armor Plating(Drops directly from boss, must be synced)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPaladin's Midan Arms (IL 245)OtherN/ACBlue1Midan Metal AxeMarauder's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal GreatswordDark Knight's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal SpearLancer's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal KnucklesPugilist's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal KatanaSamurai's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal DaggersRogue's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal BowArcher's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal MusketoonMachinist's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal RodTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal GrimoireArcanist's Grimoire245CBlue1Midan Metal RapierRed Mage's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal CodexScholar's Arm245CBlue1Midan Metal AstrometerAstrologian's Arm245CBlue1Midan Chest Gear Coffer (IL 240)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityMidan Weapon Coffer (IL 245)OtherN/AABasic1FaustletMinionN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchSins of the Savage Son I5CompleteAlexander: Midas (Savage).-3.2Sins of the Savage Son II10CompleteAlexander: Midas (Savage)5 times.-3.2Sins of the Savage Son III20CompleteAlexander: Midas (Savage)10 times.-3.2Mightier than Justice5CompleteAlexander - The Burden of the Son (Savage)with a party of onlyblue mages,Silence Echoturned on, andUnrestricted Partyturned off.-5.15RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
