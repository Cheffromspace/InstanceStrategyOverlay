The Dusk Vigil

Level: 51 (Sync: 52)  
Item Level: 100
Difficulty: Normal
Party size: Light Party 4 man
Unsyncing: Allowed  
Time limit: 90 minutes

"In the days following the Calamity, western Coerthas was abandoned by the knights of Ishgard, save for the Dusk Vigil, whose defenders refused to withdraw. Since then, the fortress has only fallen further into disrepair, and her garrison has long since been presumed dead. Unlike most Ishgardians, who would sooner put the tragic episode behind them, Father Wealdtheow would have you enter the forsaken fortress and reclaim a priceless treasure: an ice rondel set in the crown of a sculpture within the vigil's chapel. A simple request, perhaps, but if experience has taught you anything, such tasks are anything but..."

Bosses:

Towering Oliphant
- Casts Rear, an AoE around himself
- Roomwide Prehistoric Trumpet attack
- Will occasionally target a player and use Rock of Ages (stun), Wooly Inspiration (conal pull attack), and/or Rout (charge)

Ser Yuhelmeric  
- Summons adds. Melee adds do some AoE attacks, caster adds cast a buff around themselves. Move the boss away from the caster adds as they spawn to avoid stacking the buff.
- Uses Death Spiral, an AoE which hits everything not in/near melee range of him. Be aware of this when dealing with adds.

Opinicus
- The boss starts with several crumbled piles of masonry scattered around the room, similar to Garuda.
- Alpine Draft line attack, easy to avoid. 
- Freefall - Opinicus turns to face one player and jumps on them. This will destroy any piles of rubble the player is standing near.
- Whirling Gaol room wide - the outer sides of the room will start pushing you in towards the center, where you will be stunned and then hit for some damage. Hiding behind some of the crumbled masonry in the room will prevent you from being pushed into the center.
- Winds of Winter - AE attack for moderate damage and stacks wind vulnerability on anyone struck. Avoid by standing so there is a pile of rubble between you and the boss. This attack will destroy all piles of rubble and new ones will fall from the ceiling.

Loot drops are listed for the bosses and treasure coffers.
