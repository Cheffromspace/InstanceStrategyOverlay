With the disaster that befell the Void Ark, however, the island's intended residents never arrived. Cait Sith is convinced that Diabolos has instead claimed this refuge as his own, transforming what was to be a bastion of hope into a voidsent nest of shadowy nightmare. And it is into this fiendish lair that you must delve.The Lady Radlia stands ready to bear you across the skies.

Throughout the fight, the boss moves between these sides to attack you and make you fly off to your death.First HalfThe boss opens up withVoid Death. This is a large red-black, circle area of effect (AoE) at the center that pulls you in a couple times. You must keep running away from it or anyone caught in it dies.Next, it castsVoid Aero IIand marks three players with green spread markers. Go to a place away from everyone to place the tornado. Anyone walking into the tornado will get hurt by Biting Wind, which gives you small damage and theWindburndebuff. Windburn can be removed withEsuna.When the boss castsVoid Blizzard II, avoid the fan AoE by going to either side or on the safe spots in between. If you don’t, you receive a large amount of damage fromVoid Blizzard IIIand get theFrostbitedebuff. Frostbite can be removed withEsunaThroughout the fight, the boss castsDoomsaywhich randomly givesDoomto one to two players.Healersmust useEsunato remove them or they will die when the countdown ends.Aero III wind directionIf the boss castsVoid Aero III, immediately get close to either purple walls on the top and bottom of the ship. A green circular wind will appear in the center that causes proximity-based damage and knockback, so make sure you aren’t too close to it or you may die from damage. If you aren’t against a wall, you may fly off to your death.NOTE: The wind makes you fly in a straight line from the center, so you must be perpendicular to the purple wall to fly into it. See the image on the left to see the direction of where the wind blows.Where to stand for Blizzard IVWhenVoid Blizzard IVis cast, stand directly opposite of either proximity markers and take the damage. Ice blocks are dropped where the marker is located, and the boss immediately castsVoid Aero IV. If you try to stand where you take the least amount of damage from the proximity marker, you might not have enough time to get to the ice block. If you stand where the opposite side of the ice block was located, you will fly to the block whenVoid Aero IVis cast, blocking you from falling off. Anyone who didn’t fly into the block will fall to their deaths.NOTE: You can also useSurecastorArm's Lengthto stop you from flying off, but make sure to time it right because you only have a five or six-second duration.Second HalfIn the latter half, everything repeats with some differences.The boss castsDoomsaymore often, and only one proximity marker is placed on the floor when the boss castsVoid Blizzard IV.AfterVoid Aero IIIis cast, the boss immediately flies right beside a purple wall and castsBolt of Darkness.The boss shoots out a large, column AoE across the ship while the green wind on the center fromVoid Aero IIIblows people away.Bolt of Darknessgives youBleed, which can be removed withEsuna. If you can, go to the purple wall where the boss isn’t next to, to avoidBolt of Darkness.Make sure to kill the two Void Sprites that spawn randomly. Avoid their cone AoE when they castDark II.Since the beginning of the fight, the boss places random gray squares on the ship’s floor. In this half, the boss finally usesVoid Death IV, which makes the squares pulse. Anyone standing on them when the cast is done, dies.Overview of Skills and AbilitiesSkill/Action*DetailsAmt of DamageAoE?Esuna?Void DeathKeep running away from the center even after it pulls you in.High-DeathXDoomsayRemoveDoomfrom targeted party members.DeathXVoid Aero II- Green spread marker- Place at away from everyoneMediumVoid Blizzard IIBig fan AoE with safe spots split between.LargeXVoid Aero IIIGet to purple wall on either side to avoid knockback and damage.Low-DeathBolt of DarknessLarge column AoE that the boss shoots across the ship.MediumXXVoid Blizzard IV- Proximity markers- Stand directly opposite of the proximity marker and take the damage.Small-HighVoid Aero IVBlows you across the ship.

The scythes stay on the ground, dealing damage to anyone close to them and gives Flesh Wound, which can be removed usingEsuna. If you are targeted, go to a place away from other players until the boss throws the scythes at you.The boss has two mechanics that you need to watch out for:WormholeandDebilitator.ForWormhole, look at what is being tethered to the Atomos and what color the tethered Atomos is. If the Atomos is tethered to a yellow ring, stand right below the other same-colored Atomos to avoid the room-wide donut AoE and a stack ofVulnerability Up. If the Atomos is tethered to a blue ball, avoid the other same-colored Atomos to avoid the large circle AoE surrounding it and a stack ofVulnerability Up. At the beginning of the fight, only one Atomos is tethered. Later, two Atomos are tethered. If two Atomos are tethered to blue balls, the safe spot is always at the perpendicular area between them. Try to avoid the center where the two AoEs overlap or you will die. If one is tethered to a yellow ring and the other a blue ball, always stand below the other same-colored Atomos that was tethered to the yellow ring.ForDebilitator, the boss places a debuff on everyone making you weak to either fire or water and spawns several blue and red puddles throughout the room. All the puddles have to be the opposite of what you are debuffed with by stepping on the puddle to change the color. If you are debuffed with Water Resistance Down II, all the puddles must be red. If you are debuffed with Fire Resistance Down II, all the puddles must be blue. Afterwards, Feridad castsFlameflowand deals room-wide damage based on how many puddles are the wrong color.At around 60% health, the boss goes to the middle of the room and becomes untargetable. Several Wailing Atomos are spawned around him. Avoid the front of the Atomos as they shoot Feridad’s Fools from their mouths. Anyone in front of the Atomos gets hit and receives a stack ofVulnerability Up.
Kill the adds and avoid looking at one of the Feridads that castPetrifying Eye, a gaze marker giving anyone looking at its directionPetrification. Afterwards, Atomos spawns around the edge of the room and at the center. The Feridads castLucky Pierrotin which they dash to the Atomos at the edge and transport back out from the center dealing damage to anyone in the way. At the same time, a Feridad castsIcefallwhich leaves a circular AoE under a player. After the transport, the boss castsJester’s Reward, an AoE that covers half of the room. Anyone caught in the AoE will die. If the adds aren’t all killed, Atomos spawns again to transport the Feridads.
After all the adds are killed, the boss hits everyone with an unavoidable room-wide damage, Jester’s Jig .Overview of Skills and AbilitiesSkill/Action*DetailsAmt of DamageAoE?Esuna?red target marker(Abyssal Scythe)Place scythes away from everyone.MediumXXJongleur’s XTankbusterMediumJester’s ReapCone AoE in front of bossMediumXDebilitatorStep on puddles to change the color to blue if weak against fire or red if weak against water.FlameflowRoom-wide damage based on amount of puddles that aren’t the opposite of weakness debuffSmall-LargeBlackblotStackmarkerSmall-LargeWormhole- Avoid the same-colored tethered Atomos with blue balls.- Stand under the same-colored tethered Atomos with yellow ring.Medium-DeathXBlackfire- Find a large space between the circle AoEs.- Several circle AoEs that gradually grows.Medium-DeathX*Italicized words are names of casts that are shown in the cast bar.Proto UltimaMagitek Ray(no cast bar): Telegraphed trio of line AoE lasers.  The boss will face a random direction for the first laser cast, then while remaining facing in that direction, cast the next two at a 45-degree angle to the left and right of the first one.Aetherochemical Flare: Raidwide damage.Diffractive Laser(no cast bar): Untelegraphed frontal cone tankbuster. Do not be in front of the boss if not a tank.Aether Bend(no cast bar): Initially telegraphed circular AoEs that will follow random players.After losing enough health, the boss will become untargetable and a stack marker on an orb will appear in the middle (Eikonizer). The entire party should stack, then move to the walls because a proximity marker (Flare Star) will spawn. The outside of the arena will also become unsafe.Afterwards, two moreFlare Starproximity markers will spawn opposite each other, so the party should move away from both.A telegraphed line AoE will then spawn through the middle.TwoAllagan Dreadnaughtswill spawn and the tanks should get aggro while the party defeats these. They will doRotoswipe, a telegraphed conal AoE, andWrecking Ball, a circle AoE.Multiple immobileProto Bitswill spawn, which should be defeated quickly. These will each use a narrow donut AoE (Integrated Aetheromodulator) followed by a large conal AoE (Diffractive Laser). The boss will also become targetable and useMagitek Ray.After losing more health, the boss will become untargetable again and spawn three immobileAether Collectors. These must all be destroyed to make the boss vulnerable again.During this, the boss will slowly castSupernovaand must be defeated before this cast finishes, or the party will wipe. The DPS check for this encounter is generally a non-issue.ScathachThirty Thorns: Untelegraphed three part tank buster, followed by a very short telegraph melee-range AoE.  Move out of melee range to avoid this.Shadespin: Wings get big and do an hourglass aoe in the direction they are facing, get between the wings.  She will always slap either her front left and back right, or front right and back left (opposite quadrants around the boss's hitbox), so simply move to a quadrant around the boss that her wings are not extended over during the cast.While she has the wings out, she will occasionally dash to a location and perform a much larger version of the melee AoE fromThirty Thorns.  Ensure you avoid melee range after she does this dash.Shadow Links: When the message "Shadows gather on the floor" appears and the room turns dark, stop all movement, otherwise shadows hands will grab you from below, slowing your movement and inflicting a bleed.Shadethrust: Occasionally she will turn toward party and perform a line AoE, sidestep it.Connla add: needs to be grabbed by an offtank and killed away from Scathach, if it gets close they tether and buff her. If left alive it wipes the raid.Nox orbs: Circular red and black marker will be put on some players. Affected players should bait the orbs away from group by constantly moving away from other players.Shadow Limbs (giant hands): link to a player and follows them, if it reaches the players it kills them. The tethered player can face the Shadow Limb to stop their movement. The Limbs must be killed, they can switch tethers to a different player.Thirty Arrows: Periodically, a blue pool will appear at a random location.  Shortly after, either an asterisk pattern of line telegraphs or a sequence of line telegraphs will appear from where the pool was, dealing damage to anyone in those telegraphs shortly thereafter.At 50%, Scathach will enter a cocoon and spawn adds, including a Chimera with the typical Chimera moveset, these can be interrupted.These adds must be killed, or she will wipe upon emerging from the cocoon.During this phase, towers will spawn around the room that require one person each in them to avoid raid-wide damage.DiabolosPhase 1: DiabolosIn this phase Diabolos can be stunned. Melees and tanks can stun most casted abilities.Nightmare- Look away from Diabolos, inflictsSleepUltimate Terror- Donut AoE - Stand close or very far awayRuinous Omen- Raidwide AoENight Terror- Stack marker on random player, stack to share damage.Shadethrust- Line AoE in front of Diabolos, dodge to the sides or backKillDeathgateswhen they spawn to avoid addsPhase 2: Intermission / LifegateKillLifegate5 times.  Each time it reaches 0 health, it will refill and gain a stack of a buff increasing its max HP. KillDeathgateswhen they spawn to avoid adds.Phase 3: Diabolos HollowUpon pulling Diabolos Hollow, the party will receive a checkpoint that they will restart from if they wipe. Diabolos starts with a large absorb shield that grants the boss 100% crit chance on all attacks. Watch main tank's HP until shield breaks, as the boss will repeatedly castHollow Camisado, a tankbuster that can destroy tanks due to the 100% crit chance while the shield is upKillDeathgates, and when a largerDiabolic Gatewith a glowing circle around it spawns in the center, a portion of the raid should enter it and kill the add inside.  The people that go inside can be assigned, or simply free-for-all'd.Diabolos CastsHollow Camisado- Heavy Tankbuster, does around 25k damage.  Guaranteed crit at the start of the phase due to the boss's absorb shield, so tanks should use CDs and healers should ensure tanks get topped up rapidly.Shadethrust- Line AoE in front of Diabolos, dodge to the sides or back.Hollow Nightmare- Upgraded version of Nightmare. Look away from Diabolos, inflictsDoomHollow Terror- Upgraded version of Night Terror. Stand at melee range or far awayHollow Omen- Raidwide AoEBlindside- Stack marker on tankEarthshaker- Marks 3 players for a cone AoE, originating from the bos.  Stand away from each other.Other MechanicsNox- Chases 2 players with big AoEs. Run away from the party, and keep running until it ends.Hollow Night- Stack marker & gaze attack originating from the marked player.  This player should move slightly away from the boss, so everyone else can stand between them and the boss to share the stack damage, but remain faced away from that player.Particle Beam- Stand in the towers to soak damage. Middle tower is for tanks only.Diabolic Gate- Go in and kill the add. Wipes the party if you fail.Critical Gravity- Soak red orbs at the edges to avoid splashing the party.LootSee also:Diabolic ArmorDeathgaze Hollow10Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDiabolic Boots of AimingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Boots of CastingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Boots of HealingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Circlet of MaimingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Hat of AimingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Hat of CastingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Hat of HealingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Helm of FendingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Sabatons of FendingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Sabatons of MaimingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Thighboots of ScoutingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Thighboots of StrikingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Turban of ScoutingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Turban of StrikingHead260CBlue1Ferdiad Hollow20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDiabolic Bottoms of AimingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of CastingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of FendingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of MaimingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of ScoutingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of StrikingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Dress Gloves of HealingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Gauntlets of FendingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Gauntlets of MaimingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Gloves of ScoutingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Gloves of StrikingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Halfgloves of AimingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Halfgloves of CastingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Trousers of HealingLegs260CBlue1Scathach30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDiabolic Boots of AimingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Boots of CastingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Boots of HealingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Coat of AimingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Coat of CastingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Coat of HealingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Dolman of ScoutingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Dolman of StrikingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Mail of FendingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Mail of MaimingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Sabatons of FendingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Sabatons of MaimingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Thighboots of ScoutingFeet260CBlue1Diabolic Thighboots of StrikingFeet260CBlue1Diabolos40Allagan Tomestone of Poetics1Mhachi MatterNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDiabolic Bottoms of AimingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of CastingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of FendingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of MaimingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of ScoutingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Bottoms of StrikingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Circlet of MaimingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Coat of AimingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Coat of CastingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Coat of HealingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Dolman of ScoutingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Dolman of StrikingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Dress Gloves of HealingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Gauntlets of FendingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Gauntlets of MaimingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Gloves of ScoutingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Gloves of StrikingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Halfgloves of AimingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Halfgloves of CastingHands260CBlue1Diabolic Hat of AimingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Hat of CastingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Hat of HealingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Helm of FendingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Mail of FendingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Mail of MaimingBody260CBlue1Diabolic Trousers of HealingLegs260CBlue1Diabolic Turban of ScoutingHead260CBlue1Diabolic Turban of StrikingHead260CBlue1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityVoid MatterMaterialN/AABasic1Wind-up ScathachMinionN/AABasic1Diabolos Hollow CardTriple Triad CardN/A1RewardsWhen originally released, players could receive only one reward item per week for completing duties in Dun Scaith.
