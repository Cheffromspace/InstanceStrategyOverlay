Also known asA3S, it is the third sector ofAlexander: Gordias (Savage).Contents1Strategy1.1Living Liquid1.2Phase 11.3Phase 21.4Phase 31.5Phase 42Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 2StrategyLiving LiquidPlayers should assign specific positions around the arena for each player to avoid a mechanic that repeats throughout the fight. Players can use the segments on the floor to assign positions.Phase 1The main tank should pull the boss to the center of the room. This will make it easier to deal with mechanics.Fluid Swing: A wide frontal cleave. Players should avoid getting hit by this attack, as it deals massive damage and is hard to heal through in conjunction with other mechanics. Players should avoid standing in front of the boss for this altogether.Protean Wave: This attack hits twice. First, three telegraphs come out on the ground, then 6 random players will be marked. Players should move to their assigned positions to avoid overlapping with other players.Splash: High raid-wide AoE damage. Mitigate and heal through.Sluice: Random players will be marked, so spread out to assigned positions. When the attack fires, marked players are hit by splash damage, as well as AoEs are marked on the floor. Players will have to avoid these AoEs as well as marked players to avoid excessive damage. The boss will then transform into its hand form.Phase 2Fluid Strike: A frontal tankbuster that needs to be split to survive.Wash Away: All players will be pushed back a set distance. Players should stack in the center of the room to avoid being knocked off the edge.Digititis: A random tank, healer and DPS will be targeted. After the cast goes off, debuffs will be applied to these targeted players:Red:Damage Downwill be applied to the DPS.Green:Healing Downwill be applied to the healer.Blue:Vulnerability Upwill be applied to the tank.Players must swap debuffs to avoid detrimental effects from applying to each role. Debuffs must be swapped EXTREMELY quickly (the first debuffs have a timer of around 5 seconds - once this is over they change to unpassable ones), and can only be swapped once, so players must communicate with each other. Players should swap debuffs in the following way:Bluedebuffs should be given to DPS.Reddebuffs should be given to the healer.Greendebuffs should be given to the tank.This will help minimize the detriment to each player according to the strengths and weaknesses of their role.Fluid Strikex2: Players with theVulnerability Updebuff should avoid stacking for this attack. The boss will follow this up with anotherWash Away, so players will need to stack again. The boss will then split into two hands. Each tank should grab one hand.Fluid Swing: Players should still move out of this. Each hit will now also apply a debuff to tanks. Be sure to face this away from the raid.Hand of Prayer/Hand of Parting: One of the hands will begin to glow and will either turn into an open hand or a fist. The hands need to be separated or brought together accordingly (If the hand is open, bring them together. If it is a fist, separate them).  The hands will then slam into the ground and deal raid-wide damage. If the hands have been moved properly, they will do a small amount of damage. If moved incorrectly however, they will deal massive damage and debuff the party.The boss will perform anotherDigititis, so players will have to swap debuffs again.Equilibrium Concentration: One of the hands will take HP from another. Players should identify which hand has more HP and focus their attacks on it. Players will have 25 seconds to balance the hands' HP.Hand of Pain: If the hands are brought within 4% HP of each other, this attack will deal normal damage. If players fail to balance the hand's HP, they will wipe. This is a DPS check. The boss will follow up with anotherHand of Prayer/Partingand anotherFluid Swing. The hands will then move to the center.Phase 3Ads will begin to spawn in the center of the arena and start moving towards the edge. If an ad gets to the edge, they will debuff the party withParalyzeand deal massive damage.
The ads spawn in 6 waves:2Piston Lubricant3Gear Lubricant1 Piston, 2 Gears4 Gears3 Gears4 PistonsThePiston Lubricantwill castMucilage, which will cause them to sprint to the edge of the arena. This attack needs to be interrupted and the ads need to be focused down.
TheGear Lubricantmove slowly and have lower HP but should still be taken out quickly.
On top of this, in waves 2 and 4, the boss will castDrainage, targeting 2 random players with tethers that will eventually explode. Tanks should take these tethers and move away from the party to avoid overlapping damage with other players. On waves 3 and 5, the boss will castFerrofluid, marking two sets of players withPositiveandNegativemarkers and tethering them together. if tethered players have the same markers, they need to stand close together. If they have opposite markers, they need to move far apart. When the debuffs resolve, players will either be pushed away or pulled together. If players handle this mechanic incorrectly, they will be heavily debuffed and not survive the next attack. The boss will then transform back into his humanoid form.Phase 4This final phase is a loop of several mechanics, or a pairing of mechanics requiring players to move quickly and carefully in order to resolve them properly.Cascade: High raid-wide damage. This attack also spawns puddles randomly around the arena. Though the placement of these puddles is random, players can figure out their effects based on their placement:The 'lone' puddle will castProtean Wave.The two puddles that are close together will useEmbolus'andThrottle(left puddle) andDrainage(right puddle).Ferrofluid: Players should move to their assigned positions for this, as this attack will target all players, so being able to identify who players are tethered to and moving accordingly is key.Fluid Swing: Adds debuffs to the main tank. Tanks need to swap around 4 stacks, which will line up with the next cast ofCascade.Splash: Mitigate and heal through.Sluice/Protean Wave: Players will need to spread out forSluice, dodge the first hit ofProtean Wave, then separate for the second attack.Sluice/Digititis: This time, twoRedmarkers will come out, so both healers will need to take these, while a free DPS needs to take theBluedebuff.Cascade: Mitigate and heal through again. Three new puddles will spawn.Liquid Gaol: A healer will be targeted. The marked healer needs to move away from the rest of the party, as after the cast resolves, the healer and all players around them will be stunned. aLiquid Limbwill spawn and pick up the stunned healer and begin to move them towards the edge. The limb must be defeated before this happens. If successful, the healer will be released.Splash: Mitigate and heal through.Digititis: This attack will be the exact same as last time.Splash x6: This will cause massive damage, so healers should be ready for this.One of the puddles will cast a single lineProtean Wave, so avoid accordingly, followed by anotherCascade.Throttle: A random player will be debuffed withThrottle, when it resolves the player will be killed. This needs to be dispelled immediately. The boss will cast another party-wideFerrofluid, so stack or spread accordingly, followed by anotherThrottlewhich needs to be dispelled.Embolus: Summons a ball that moves towards the boss. If it touches the boss or another player, it is most likely a wipe. The main tank should move the boss as soon as they see the ball appear, and all players should stay clear of its path.Drainage/Protean Wave: Tanks will take the tethers again, and players will dodge the hits ofProtean Wave. This will be followed by anotherSluice.A puddle will castEmbolusagain, this time players should move the boss back to the center. The boss will follow up with anotherFluid Swing, and the mechanics will repeat from the beginning of phase 4.Players will have to defeat the boss in this time, or the boss will enrage and wipe the party.Loot15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsGordian Manifesto - Page 3Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityGordian Leg Gear Coffer (IL 210)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityGordian Head Gear Coffer (IL 210)OtherN/AABasic1Gordian Hand Gear Coffer (IL 210)OtherN/AABasic1Gordian Foot Gear Coffer (IL 210)OtherN/AABasic1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
