Always crits. Tanks take awareness killSpellblade:Holy: 3 AOE's + Stack. Boss will also cast Pole Shift which switches the tethered players positions. In this case have party stack with the player tethered to stack mechanic, and have other 2 tethers spread away from these.During Libary phase: You will receive 2 stacks and 4 AOEs. To handle this you have the 4 AOEs go in 1 Green Book each granting physical vun down. The 2 stacks and 2 unmarked will go into Blue Books, granting magic vun down. This enables the stacks to be soaked by 2 players.Fire 3: AOE around the boss, under the boss is safe.Blizzard 3: AOE around boss, dodge out.Thunder 3: Line AOE.Panel Swap: Changes arena type, also changes effect of next mechanic:Queen's Waltz: Effect changes on the panel she is stood in. Effects are introduced in order, but later will switch based on where she jumps too.Plain area: Casts the A3S protean wave mechanic targeting all players with conal AOEs. Spread around boss and don't overlap other players.Forest: Boss casts T6 Thorny vines tethering tanks/healers with DPS. Run apart with Tanks/healers going one way , DPS the otherCave: Casts pillars in non-blue tiles ala normal mode. Comes with raid wide AOE dmg.Library: Each player takes a non-booked panel, at the end of the cast a book falls on each player dealing ½ max HP.Haste: Increases cast time of next mechanic.Haste 3: Increases cast time for set duration. Final phase only.Dimensional Wave: Medium raid wide AOE DMGPlaying field: Swaps tiles on arena to DPS/Tank/Healer, and later Pig/Frog/Imp. All must be stood on, by correct player type.The Game: Triggers playing fields.Oink: Red Triangles. Stack to prevent turning into pigs.Ribbit: Conal AOE in front of boss. Turns you into frog.Squelch: Look away mechanic, turns you into imp if looking at boss.Place Token: Spawns adds based on phase. All adds hit very hard.Forest Phase: White Flame- DPS down ASAP, tank boss away as she continues to do circular AOE'sCave: Spawns greater dragon. OT picks up and tanks it near boss within blue panels.Library: Spawns Apanda, hits hard, casts Magic Hammer which creates circular AOE's under players.Final Phase: Spawns Iron Giant + Ninjas. Need to be tanked seperately, MT picks up giant, OT ninjas. Mage LB these and burn down before they wipe raid.Mind Jack: Gives players forward/left/right/retreat marches later causing them to run in that direction based on where they are facing. Will be paired with other mechanics.Waltz (Thorns + Spellblade Fire 3): DPS position to run south. Tanks and healers run north. This breaks vines and takes players out of AOE.Dark Tokens: In final phase mindjack is paired with dark tokens, you must face so you remain within central 4 squares, and so that mindjack makes you on the opposite corner to the token you are tethered with. This maximizes the tether distance so it doesn't kill the player.Place Dark token: First time you see during the cave phase this it will spawn 4 reapers on the outer edges that deal line AOE dmg, and 1 reaper in the centre. One of the blue panels will be a safe spot. This can be found as no reapers will line up with the panel.Mechanics Order:Phase 1 StandardCritical HitSpellblade Holy + Pole ShiftWaltz - Protean WaveHasteSpellblade / RandomDimensional WavePlaying FieldOinkThe GamePanel Swap - Phase 2 ForestWaltz - Thorny Vines + Spellblade FireHasteSpellblade ThunderCritical HitDimensional WavePlace Token - White FlameMindjack + Waltz vinesDimensional WavePanal Swap - Phase 3 cavePlace Token - DragonWaltz - Pillars + raid wide damageRibbit - DPS, healers and OT need to hide on far corner to avoid, then move out to avoid cleaveCritical HitPlace Dark Token + Waltz - Safe will be one of two inner blue panels.HasteSpellbladeDimensional WavePanal Swap - Phase 4 LibraryWaltz - Each party member takes a non-book panel each, folio will do ½ max HPOinkPlace Token - ApandaWaltz + Magic HammerSquelchDimensional WaveCritical HitDimensional WaveSpellblade Holy - 2 stacks + 4 AOEs, use books.
