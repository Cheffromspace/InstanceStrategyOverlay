For the time being, the best course of action appears to be continuing with efforts to restore balance to the ambient aether of the Empty. The next element is lightning, which once ravaged the Gandof Thunder Plains in the time before the Flood of Light.

However, should any participant fall, they can be raised after a moderate delay.In addition, you will notice lane-like patterns on the arena-floor which will help with various mechanics, specificallyTribunal Summons.Crippling Blow- a vicious tank-buster against the primary target that should be mitigated whenever possible.Stratospear Summons (1)- calls down two AoE circles at the eastern and western sides of the arena that should be avoided. After a brief delay, lightning rods (stratospears) will fall at the location of the AoE circles, one larger than the other. All participants should move to the side with theshortestlightning rod, as the largest will attract lightning and unleash a massive AoE (Judgement Jolt) from its location after a delay, zapping anyone nearby for massive damage.The resulting AoE will also form small orbs of lightning around the point of impact that will provideSurge Protection(lightning resistance) to anyone who collects them, which will be required for future mechanics. Players can stack the buff up to three times. However, anyone exceeding three orbs will instead receive ahealing receiveddebuff. As a rule of thumb, it is best to collect one, possibly two, but leave them for whenever necessary, as every member of the raid will need at least one orb for themselves during upcoming mechanics.Stormcloud Summons- Ramuh marks two random players with a purple overhead marker. After a moderate delay, each player with the marker will drop a large storm cloud at their location that will bombard the designated area with periodic blasts of lightning AoE unto anyone standing underneath it. Additionally, the clouds will merge into a gigantic storm cloud if they are placed too close together - inflicting unavoidable raid-wide damage andDamage Downinstead. As a result, it is wise to drop these storm clouds at the outer edges of the arena away from the rest of the group (and each other).Judgement Volts- blasts the arena with unavoidable raid-wide damage.Fury's Bolt- provides Ramuh with a buff, indicated by three orbs of purple lightning that circle him. Whenever Ramuh has this buff, the next mechanic will become much more potent, such as:(Divine) Judgement Volts- blasts the arena with unavoidable (fatal) raid-wide damage. To avoid, players must collect (or have already collected) at least oneSurge Protectionorb to reduce the damage. Bear in mind that having multiple orbs will not increase the damage absorption. If you haven't already, grab a lightning orb as soon as possible. Considering that this threat will happen at various times throughout the encounter, always ensure that you have at least one stack ofSurge Protectionwhenever you see Ramuh have the three circling orbs (Fury's Boltbuff).Tribunal Summons (1)- creates theWill of Ramuhoutside of the southern edge of the arena center. After a brief delay, theWill of Ramuhwill dash in a straight line through the arena, indicated by an obvious telegraph (as well as the 'lane' pattern on the arena floor). After dashing, all players will suffer damage and knockback regardless of their position. To handle this, all players must ensure they are not directly in the path of theWill of Ramuh. Instead, everyone should stand directly beside the 'charge line'. By doing so, everyone will take minor damage and avoid being knocked off the platform, whereas anyone standing too far away from the central line risks being knocked off the platform entirely. Bear in mind thatKnockback Immunitycan prevent the knockback effect.Tribunal Summons (2)- summons threeWill of Ixion's at the eastern or western edge of the arena which, like the previous mechanic, will prepare to dash across the arena in a straight line. When in doubt, you will notice them standing next to line-like patterns on the arena floor (lanes), showing the direction (and width) of upcoming dashes. All players must ensure they are not caught in the path by moving to a safe 'lane'.Stratospear Summons (2)- calls downfourAoE circles at the eastern and western sides of the arena that should be avoided. After a brief delay, lightning rods (stratospears) will once again fall at the location of the AoE circles, one smaller than the rest. Similar to earlier, all participants should move to thecornerwith theshortestlightning rod. The remaining three (large) lightning rods will eventually unleash a massive AoE from their locations that covers the majority of the arena and zaps anyone caught in the blast(s) for massive damage. Just like before, allStratospear Summonswill eventually lead to the spawning ofSurge Protectionorbs. Feel free to pick one up right away, or be ready to grab one soon after.(Divine) Judgement Volts- blasts the arena once more with unavoidable raid-wide damage, with each player requiring at least oneSurge Protection(orb) to avoid being fatally wounded.Thunderstorm- bombards the arena with a constant barrage of small AoE circles at random locations and large AoE circles underneath various players, forcing a lot of movement to avoid taking damage.From this point onward, Ramuh will begin tocombomechanics.Tribunal Summons (1)+Stormcloud Summons- creates theWill of Ramuhoutside of the southern edge of the arena center whilst simultaneously marking 2-3 players with purple markers (storm clouds). Marked players will have time to drop their storm clouds away from each other, preferably at the outer corners of the arena, while everyone (marked players included) must then move next to theWill of Ramuhcharge-line to avoid being knocked off the platform (or under storm clouds).Tribunal Summons (2)+Thunderstorm- summons threeWill of Ixion's at the eastern or western edge of the arena which will prepare to dash across the arena in a straight line. Simultaneously, all players will have to contend with a barrage of small AoE's at random locations as well as large AoE's underneath various players - all whilst trying to remain within a 'safe lane' to avoid theWill of Ixion's.Stratospear Summons (1)+Stormcloud Summons- calls down two AoE circles at the eastern and western sides of the arena that should be avoided. Like before, lightning rods will be dropped at these locations (one smaller than the other), indicating which side of the arena will be safe. Simultaneously, various players will be marked with storm cloud markers. As a result, marked players must ensure that they drop their storm clouds away from each other (preferably in each corner of the safe-side of the arena), whilst everyone else stacks in the middle of the safe-side to avoid the upcoming AoE blast from the large lightning rod.Tribunal Summons (1) + (2)- summons theWill of Ramuhat the southern center of the arena, as well as threeWill of Ixion's at the eastern or western edge of the arena, all of which will prepare to charge down their lanes simultaneously. To avoid, the raid must ensure they are standing within a 'safe lane' to avoid being crushed by aWill of Ixion, whilst also being close to the 'charge-line' in the center to avoid being knocked off the platform by theWill of Ramuh.If you have reached this point, Ramuh will now enter a mechanical loop, using nothing that you haven't witnessed already, continuing until Ramuh (or the raid) have been defeated.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityHelm of Golden AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Armor of Golden AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Chausses of Golden AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Bangle of Golden AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityHelm of Golden AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Gauntlets of Golden AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Greaves of Golden AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Bangle of Golden AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 3NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTwice Stricken Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1DialogueRamuh: Thou wouldst forge this world anew?
