Also known asA9S, it is the first floor inAlexander: The Creator.Contents1Strategy1.1Refurbisher 01.2Phase 11.3Phase 21.4Phase 31.5Phase 41.6Phase 51.7Phase 62Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 2StrategyRefurbisher 0This fight consists of mechanics that repeat through each phase, with each phase adding new mechanics to the fight that players must take into consideration when maneuvering around the boss.In each phase, quadrants of the walls around the arena will begin to glow, indicating that part of the floor will flood with lava. Standing in the lava will deal high damage and inflict a heavy fire Damage over Time debuff. This lava is also used to handle another mechanic that repeats through the fight.Every phase,Scrap Botswill spawn around the arena, along withEnergy Generators. The boss uses these bots to rebuild parts of its body if they aren't destroyed. Players will use the generators to revive the bots, drag them to the glowing areas, burn them down and melt their bodies in the lava. This will prevent the boss from using them to rebuild parts of its body.Before the fight begins, assign 2 players to handle grabbing the generators and placing them near the ads. It is recommended to assign the off tank and a healer.
The boss will start with three debuffs:Left Arm Reassembly,Right Arm Reassembly, andMain Hull Reassembly. Absorbing differentScrap Botswill reduce these debuffs by one stack, as well as add a permanentDamage Upbuff. When the debuff is completely removed, the boss will regrow parts of its body and add new attacks to its repertoire. If the boss regrows its main hull, it will castScrap Stormand wipe the party.Phase 1At the beginning of the fight, three bots will drop, and the boss will immediately castStockpile, absorbing them and re-growing its right arm. This is unavoidable, so use this time to deal damage. After this the boss will begin to attack.Scrap: The boss casts a frontal column attack on the primary enmity target, namely the main tank. All other players should stand behind the boss.A quadrant of the room will begin to glow and two sets of three bots will spawn along with two generators. Have assigned players grab the generators and place them near the ads, where they will castEnergy Dischargeand awaken the bots, who will tether to the player that aggros them first. The off tank should be ready to pick these up and move them to the glowing quadrant where the rest of the party will quickly destroy them.Scrap Burst: Players will be marked with markers, on which rocks will drop. These rocks will not deal damage, and it is best to drop them near the boss as close as possible. The boss will then cast a room-wide AoE that can only be avoided by hiding behind the rocks.Stockpile: The boss will pull any remaining ads, living or dead, into itself, removing stacks of its debuff and buffing its damage.Scrapline: A massive AoE with no cast bar. Players must avoid this by standing behind the boss, while the main tank stands in front and uses cooldowns to survive.Phase 2Mechanics from the first phase will repeat here, however the boss has additional attacks:Acid Rain: Four players will randomly be targeted with markers which spawn AoEs. The damage will also deal splash damage, so players should avoid standing near marked players.Players will move the generators to the ads and handle them the same way as before.Scrap Bomb: A player will be marked with a stack marker. Group up to mitigate the damage. The boss will try to useStockpileagain and follow up with anotherScrapline.Phase 3At the start of this phase,Full-Metal Faustwill spawn as indicated by a proximity marker, which players should move as far away from as possible. Once it spawns, it will tether to the boss and render it almost invulnerable. Faust should be picked up immediately and kept out of the lava, since if it touches the lava, it will castScorched Earthand wipe the raid. The off tank will be responsible for grabbing the Faust and pulling it around the arena to avoid the lava quadrants, which will now spawn quicker than before. During this, the boss will castScraplineandAcid Rainagain.  Keep moving the Faust and burn it down as quickly as possible, making sure it dies on a glowing quadrant so it can be melted down. Once it is defeated, the boss will take normal damage again. The boss will useScrapburstandStockpileagain.Phase 4The boss's mechanics and attacks will repeat here, however a new ad will spawn, anAlarum. TheAlarumshould not be burned up, instead attack it and pull it over onto one of the dividers between the sections and defeat it. When it dies, it will drop a puddle that inflictsMinimumon whoever enters it. This puddle is needed for a mechanic later, so its important that all players can access it.
Ads will spawn again, but this time only one generator will spawn, meaning its only possible to melt one mob of enemies. Do so, separating forAcid Rain, and when it castsStockpileit will regrow its left arm. It will then castDouble Scrapline, a 360-degree attack that is unavoidable and will wipe the party unless players step into the puddle and receive theMinimumdebuff, shrinking you below the attack.Phase 5The phase will repeat as the others before, except nowScrap Bombswill also spawn in the quadrants of the room. Be sure to pull theAlarumout of the range of the bombs, as they can explode and destroy it. Dodge the boss's various attacks, dropping rocks next to the boss and burn the ads down on the glowing quadrant.Phase 6By this point, all of the boss's mechanics will repeat the same as the previous phase. Burn the boss down while dodging the attacks. Eventually the boss will spawn too many ads to revive and rebuild its hull, castingScrap Stormand wiping the party. Defeat the boss before then.Loot30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsAlexandrian Manifesto - Page 1Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAlexandrian Earrings of FendingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Earrings of SlayingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Earrings of AimingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Earrings of CastingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Earrings of HealingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of FendingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of SlayingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of AimingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of CastingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of HealingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of FendingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of SlayingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of AimingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of CastingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of HealingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of FendingRing270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of SlayingRing270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of AimingRing270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of CastingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of HealingRing270CBlue1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAlexandrian Earrings of FendingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Earrings of SlayingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Earrings of AimingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Earrings of CastingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Earrings of HealingEarrings270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of FendingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of SlayingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of AimingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of CastingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Neckband of HealingNecklace270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of FendingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of SlayingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of AimingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of CastingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Bracelets of HealingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of FendingRing270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of SlayingRing270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of AimingRing270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of CastingBracelets270CBlue1Alexandrian Ring of HealingRing270CBlue1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
