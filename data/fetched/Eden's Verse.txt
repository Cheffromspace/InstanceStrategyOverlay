Here is the cleaned up text for the Eden's Verse strategy guide:

Eden's Verse is the 2nd section of Eden, the main 8-player raid in Shadowbringers. Released on February 18, 2020, Eden's Verse requires players with item level of 455 or higher to enter. Once unlocked, the raid can be queued from the Duty Finder.

Unlock
Players must first complete all of the Eden Quests up through The Next Piece of the Puzzle. This includes clearing all of the Eden's Gate raids. 
Players can then begin the level 80 quest chain starting with Away with the Faerie by talking to Yalfort in Amh Araeng (X:26.7, Y:16.7).
To unlock each floor after the first, continue the quest line and complete the consecutive floor. Each floor is listed separately.
