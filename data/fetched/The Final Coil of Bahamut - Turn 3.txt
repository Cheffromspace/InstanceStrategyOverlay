NoticeAll Lv. 50 Bahamut raids do not appear in anyDuty Roulettesdue to their high difficulty (comparable to Savage). Therefore, attempting to queue throughDuty Finderwill result in extremely long queues. For an easy completion, it is recommended that players useParty Finderand form anUnrestricted Party(i.e., with level sync disabled). Players who wish to complete this duty with level sync enabled should also form a pre-made party, which also enables the use ofMinimum Item LevelandSilence Echosettings for an additional challenge.This article is about the level 50 challenge-moderaid.

The man once gave his life that the realm might be spared; if you would honor his legacy, you must now strike him down.— In-game descriptionThe Final Coil of Bahamut - Turn 3is a level 50raidintroduced inpatch 2.4. The raid is also known asT12.Contents1Strategy1.1Phoenix1.2Phase 1: 100%-80%1.3Phase 2: 80%-52%1.4Phase 31.5Phase 4: 52%-0%2Solo strategy3Loot3.1Phoenix3.1.1Treasure Coffer 13.1.2Treasure Coffer 24Dialogue4.1Intro Cutscene4.2Post duty CutsceneStrategyPhoenixThe fight is broken down into four phases with a soft enrage around 13 minutes. Before the fight begins, players should assign locations around the arena to dropBlackfiresand assign each location to a role type: Healer, DPS and Tank. A player should also be assigned as a "debuff swapper", as well as a player to enter theBluefirepuddle later.Phase 1: 100%-80%The main tank should move the boss to the center of the arena. This makes it easier to handle mechanics.Revelation: A heavy-hitting tankbuster that debuffs withRevelation Resistance Down, making the next hit a guaranteed kill. Mitigate this attack and tank swap before the next hit.Bennu Spawns: These adds will spawn and must be moved away from the boss and killed quickly. If they are left alive too long, they will begin to buffPhoenix. In phase 3 these adds will be revived and buff any ads near them in a small AoE, so placing them appropriately to be killed is essential. It is recommended that players drop the ads at the intercardinals and one in the center of the room (in an X pattern, one in each tip, and one in the middle) to be sure they are spaced appropriately.Blackfire: One DPS, Healer and the off-tank will drop aBlackfirewhere they are standing. These act as mines that deal damage and debuff everyone withVulnerability Upif stepped on. If they are dropped too close to each other they will tether and repeatedly explode, debuffing the entire party. Drop these at the predetermined locations by waiting then quickly moving away. TheBlackfireswill also explode if not defeated quickly enough.WhitefireThe same players that were debuffed withBlackfirewill now be debuffed withWhitefireand drop an AoE that deals heavy damage.To handle these fire mechanics, players need to drop theBlackfiresat the specified markers, then drop theWhitefireson top of them. These will debuff theBlackfiresand make them easier to kill. The mechanics of this phase will repeat until the boss's HP is reduced to around 80%.Phase 2: 80%-52%At the beginning of the phase the boss will mark either a ranged player or a healer withBrand of Purgatory. This will debuff the player with either a green or purple marker and eitherChain of PurgatoryorBrand of Purgatory. Both of these debuffs work the same. The boss will then castFlames of Unforgivenesson the player that was originally debuffed. If they still have that debuff they will die.To handle this mechanic, the player that is marked and the assigned debuff swapping player will swap the debuff by passing through each others hitbox. Passing this will deal around 4000 HP damage to both players. Healers need to top the originally debuffed player off beforePhoenixfinishes its cast, otherwise it will still kill the player. The healer should then heal the player that took the debuff. To have the best chance of successfully surviving this mechanic, players should swap as soon as the cast starts.Bluefire: A random player is marked and soon after drops a small blue puddle. This needs to be dropped away from the boss otherwise it will be absorbed. If players touch this, they will receive a heavy debuff.Redfire: A fire orb will tether to a player and begin to move towards them. If it hits the player it is tethered to or anyone else, it will explode, deal heavy damage and apply a heavy hitting damage over time debuff.In order to handle these, the player assigned to the puddle will step into it after theRedfirespawns and run into the orb to destroy it. The debuff from theBluefirepuddle will prevent the damage from theRedfireorb. It will weaken the damage output and healing from the debuffed player for a short while so only step in the puddle to destroy the orb.During these mechanics the boss will still be summoningBennusand usingRevelationso handle these mechanics accordingly, being sure to drop the ads in the correct locations for the next phase.
The fight will repeat here until the boss hits roughly 52%.Phase 3At the beginning of the phase the boss will become invulnerable and summon a wall of fire around itself, instantly killing any who touch it. It will then begin constantly castingFlames of Rebirth, a room-wide AoE that stacks a buff on the boss so that each following hit ofFlames of Rebirthhits harder. This attack will also revive theBennusaround the room.The ads will still have the same enmity they did when they died so they will move towards their tank. Players should be sure to continue to defeat the ads separated from each other, so that when they revive, they don't accidentally buff the other adds near them. Players should defeat one to the east of the arena and one in the center, moving back and forth between these two locations.When theBennusare revived, they will grow in size and can be revived twice before being defeated permanently. These largerBennusare stronger and will tether together and buff one another if there are more than one up and they are within close proximity. Players should try to stagger defeatingBennusbetween each cast to avoid having more than one largeBennuup at a time.This is a small DPS check. If the boss receives too manyFlames of Rebirthbuff stacks it will wipe the raid. After the adds are defeated, the boss will lower the wall and become targetable again.Phase 4: 52%-0%The boss will cast aBrand of Purgatoryimmediately. Whoever gets this debuff should pass it to the main tank. From here the main and off tank will swap the debuff for the remainder of the fight.Fountain of Fire: A wide AoE will spawn on a random player and drop a large puddle. The puddle will then buff the boss withAttack Upup to 8 times before disappearing. Players need to take turns standing in this puddle, which will debuff and damage them instead of buffing the boss. The more stacks of the debuff a player receives, the more damage each attack deals.To handle this, the off tank will step into the puddle and soak the first four stacks of the debuff, followed by two DPS taking two stacks each.While this is happening, the boss will summonPhoenix Egisthat will either drop an easily avoidable AoE or will tether to a random player and charge them shortly after, damaging every player it hits. Every player can avoid this except for the tethered player so be sure to avoid cleaving any players unnecessarily. The boss will useRevelationhere and the tanks will swap debuffs at the same time. After the fountain is gone the boss will castFlames of Rebirth, adding a stack ofFlames of Rebirth Damage Up. The boss will summon another fountain, and it should be handled the same way. After the second fountain is gone and the boss castsFlames of Rebirth, it will disappear and summonPlumesaround the arena. Players will dodge these and thePhoenix Egis. The boss will return, and the phase will repeat from here. It should be noted that if a player dies in this phase the boss will receive a stack ofFlames of Rebirthand continue to receive them until the player is back up, so healers need to be quick with raising players.If the boss is not defeated in time, it will enrage and wipe the party.Solo strategyAs ofpatch 6.0, the duty can be easily cleared solo by any well-geared level 90 character.The boss fight consists of attacking the boss and the adds it spawns until they die. In the phase in which the boss is invulnerable and wreathed in flames, stepping into its hitbox will kill the player.LootPhoenix30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityNeo Aetherstone - Hand GearMaterialN/AABasic1Neo Aetherstone - Foot GearMaterialN/AABasic1Dreadwyrm Leg Gear Coffer (IL 130)OtherN/AABasic1Faded Copy of From the AshesOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDreadwyrm Head Gear Coffer (IL 130)OtherN/AABasic1Dreadwyrm Hand Gear Coffer (IL 130)OtherN/AABasic1Dreadwyrm Foot Gear Coffer (IL 130)OtherN/AABasic1DialogueIntro CutsceneAlisaie:Gods he is almost whole again!Alphinaud:His size is staggering... I can scarce imagine how Grandfather stood against such a monstrosity.Alisaie:This cannot be allowed to proceed any further. Let us disable the coil and move on.Alisaie:Grandfather!Alisaie:No, that man is dead. I will not dishonor my beloved grandsire's memory by calling you such.Alisaie:You are but his twisted shade—the thrall of a mad primal.Louisoix:You were foolish to disregard my warning, child. Are you so convinced of your own righteousness?Alphinaud:'Tis the rightness of our path that led us to return. Eorzea will never be safe whilst Bahamut remains to threaten all we hold dear.Alphinaud:What of the hero who gave his life in defense of the realm? Do you truly dispute the justice of our cause?Louisoix:My poor, ignorant grandchildren—your world is shaped by naught but recent conflict. Listen, and I will speak to you of "justice."Louisoix:'Twas in the twilight of the Third Astral Era... The southern land of Meracydia suffered invasion at the hands of the Allagan Empire. With no atrocity too depraved for their purpose, the forces of Allag were unstoppable in their advance.Louisoix:Desperate for salvation, the dragons prayed to one of the first brood—to their ancestor Bahamut. Infused by the power of their fervent supplications, Bahamut arose from the abyss of death and took wing as the Meracydians' newborn god.Louisoix:Yet this great miracle would only serve to further the maniacal designs of the dragons' imperial conquerors. The cruel fetters which bind my lord stand testament to the Allagans' boundless greed and hubris.Louisoix:I once summoned the Twelve in an attempt to forestall the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era.Louisoix:What then did the dragons of Meracydia do that I did not? Wherefore are they accursed and I exalted?Louisoix:'Tis man's overweening belief in his own primacy that blinds him to the commonness of his condition...and the truth of his own tyranny.Louisoix:As long as man is suffered to remain, the dragons shall never be at peace.Louisoix:Only when the plague of people has been expunged shall the children of Lord Bahamut be free. Then shall the world know true justice.Alisaie:Stop it! Grandfather would never say such things! His belief that people were worth saving never faltered!Alisaie:He had faith in their strength...that they could stand together and push back against the darkness seeking to shape them.Louisoix:A false hope. 'Tis folly to place one's faith in so flawed a race.Louisoix:"Stand together"? Hmph. They would first need to agree on which direction to face. If history teaches us anything, it is that man cannot find common ground between his own two feet.Louisoix:Even you, twins whose veins run with the same blood, struggle to fathom each other's reasoning. You hide your differing agendas behind the convenient banner of Eorzea's salvation. Given your obvious self-interest, can you truly claim no kinship with the Allagans?Louisoix:And though I hoped they might bring you closer, 'twould seem that the twin grimoires I bestowed upon you were a wasted gesture...Alphinaud:There may well be truth in your judgement of Alisaie and me... But such a one-sided tirade bemoaning the evils of man rings false coming from the lips of Archon Louisoix.Alphinaud:Tell me—do you champion the cause of dragons because Bahamut compels you as his thrall?Alphinaud:Or is it because you yourself have transcended the limits of man's existence?Louisoix:Ah, so the possibility did not escape your notice? What I prayed for, and what I have become...these are thekeysthat unlock the truth behind Eorzea's rebirth.Louisoix:If you would have them, then you must needs take them by force. come, rend this divine form asunder and claim your answers!Alisaie:But...I thought... He has become a primal!?Alphinaud:'Tis difficult I know, but you must accept it: that entity is no phantom or imposter—it is our beloved grandsire!Alisaie:Please—for his sake and for ours—you must defeat our grandfather!Post duty CutsceneAlisaie:Grandfather is truly gone this time. But better it end this way than the alternative...Louisoix:I am yet here, Alisaie. My dear, sweet, granddaughter...Alisaie:Grandfather...?Louisoix:I must thank you, Warrior of Light. Without your valor, I might never have broken free of Bahamut's control.Louisoix:These last few moments are mine to live as the man I once was.Alisaie:This is all that I wanted. Yet now that it is happening, I find myself struggling to believe it...Is it really you?Alphinaud:Grandfather, pray forgive me my insolence. It was not my intent to demean you.Louisoix:Forgive you? I am proud of you, child. You were wise enough to deduce the manner of creature I had become.Louisoix:Alphinaud. Alisaie. If any here should beg forgiveness, it is I.Alisaie:Grandfather, I must ask... Will you not tell us what befell during the Calamity?Louisoix:Yes. Yes of course. You have come far to hear the truth...Louisoix:Let us then begin the tale at the Battle of Cartenau, where clashed the forces of the Garlean Empire and the Eorzean Alliance.Louisoix:'Twas there in the sky above the surging armies that the elder primal Bahamut broke free of the red moon, Dalamud.Louisoix:In an effort to contain this avatar of destruction, I called upon the Twelve to aid me in the creation of a prison of aether...Louisoix:But Bahamut would not be caged by such feeble bars—too vast was his might; too fierce his rage.Louisoix:Little choice remained to me. I used the last of my strength to entrust our hope unto the future, and prepared to meet my end.Louisoix:As you have no doubt surmised, I did not perish. When the cage built from the essences of the Twelve was destroyed, the sky was filled with a colossal cloud of aether.Louisoix:This drifting energy responded to the prayers of those fighting below—and to my own desperate wish that the dying realm be saved—by infusing me with the power of a primal.Louisoix:I became the immortal Phoenix, ancient symbol of rebirth.Louisoix:Rising into the sky, I struck Bahamut with all my newfound strength. The blow shattered his earthly form, and a shower of aether rained down upon the land.Louisoix:Thus began the rejuvenation of Eorzea.Louisoix:Believing the deed done, I relinquished my hold on that staggering energy, desirous that it should be returned to the realm without delay.Louisoix:But I had not reckoned on Bahamut's tenacious will. Even as he teetered upon the cusp of oblivion, the dragon reached out to claim me.Louisoix:Alas, within my fast fading form, enough remained of the Phoenix's energy to offer Bahamut a hold, and he dragged me along in his wake.Alphinaud:And thus began your existence as the elder primal's thrall...Alisaie:I cannot help but wonder at his will to survive... Though he was all but obliterated, Bahamut found a way to seize the power you surrendered.Alisaie:That would explain why part of his physical form survived to be entombed underground.Alphinaud:'Twould also explain why Eorzea was so terribly warped. Even as the land sought to restore itself, the returning flow of aether was cut off.Louisoix:Very good. When his grip on existence was once again secured, Bahamut did not cease his feast until he had consumed every last mote of aether that yet floated in the air.Alisaie:'Andstillhe was not fully restored.Louisoix:You must remember that by this time, much of the freed aether had already returned to the land. That which remained was not sufficient to reconstruct so massive a form in its entirety.Louisoix:But there did not need to be—not for a being sustained by the marvels of Allagan technology.Louisoix:As long as some piece of Bahamut persists, the coils will seek it out and continue their regenerative task.Louisoix:The fragments of Dalamud appear motionless from the surface, but deep beneath the ground they had been searching...tunneling through rock and soil towards their escaped prisoner.Louisoix:And, as you have observed for yourselves, they found his heart.Louisoix:Warrior of Light, heed me. You must put a stop to Bahamut's regeneration.Louisoix:Whether it be for man or for dragonkind, the question of justice is irrelevant. The elder primal will leave naught but a smoldering wasteland for both his children and ours.Louisoix:I beg you to defend Eorzea, and guide its people to the future they yet struggle to find.Louisoix:This portal will take you to the final internment hulk. 'Tis time for the tale of Bahamut and his part in the Calamity to come to an end.Louisoix:Alphinaud, Alisaie. Pray come closer.Louisoix:Your hopes and dreams must no longer be an extension of mine. You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm—your own meaning in this sea of chaos.Louisoix:Will you do that for me?Alphinaud:Of course, Grandfather. I have already made it my mission to see this newborn Eorzea survive and flourish.Louisoix:Alisaie. While I was yet in thrall to Bahamut, you spoke of my faith in man's strength. Know that your words reached me, imprisoned though my soul still was.Louisoix:So forceful was your conviction, I wonder if that belief has not become your own. Perhaps, after all your anger and sorrow was spent, you found something greater within you.Louisoix:See this fight to its culmination. 'Tis alsoyourstrength in which I have faith.Alisaie:Thank you...for everything...Pray take your rest, Grandfather... You deserve it.Louisoix:There are records of an art that allowed one to summon the power of a primal from the essence of its demise.Louisoix:And though I am not true primal, all that I have left, I give to you.Louisoix:Alphinaud. Alisaie. My darling grandchildren. May Light's blessings ever keep and protect you.Alisaie:Come, Warrior of Light.
