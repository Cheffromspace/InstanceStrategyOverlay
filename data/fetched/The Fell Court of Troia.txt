It looks like the provided text is a disambiguation page that doesn't contain an actual strategy guide. The text mentions two related articles with similar titles:

- The Fell Court of Troia (Duty)
- The Fell Court of Troia (Zone)

As there is no strategy guide content to clean up, I don't have any further processing to do. Please provide the text of the specific strategy guide you would like me to work on.
