Any player who touches the edges of the arena for any reason will suffer moderate damage and a dispellableParalysisdebuff, rendering them unable to move, though it can be dispelled viaEsuna.Whilst facing off against this literal death-machine, players will also notice largemonitorsoutside of the arena which will give some visual hints regarding upcoming mechanics. Compared to the normal version of the battle, these monitors will be a much more prominent feature of the encounter. For example, the Guardian will load programs quite frequently, displaying sprites on the monitor which will indicate which attacks will happen next, forcing the raid to keep a close eye on the screen much more often compared to normal mode.Below is a list of all mechanics and phases represented via the monitor, as well as a list of generic mechanics you will deal with throughout the encounter (regardless of the monitor).General MechanicsBelow is a description of generic mechanics that will take place throughout the entire encounter.Magitek Ray- Guardian turns to face a random player and - after an animated wind-up - emits a straight-line AoE across the arena. As a rule of thumb, if the Guardian turns to face you or your general direction unexpectedly and you notice blue energy forming by its cannon, a hefty side-step can take you out of danger. Any player hit by the beam will suffer high damage and be afflicted with a stackableVulnerability Updebuff.Arm & Hammer- a devastating tank-buster against Guardian's current target. Be sure to mitigate the blow with cooldowns whenever possible.Atomic Ray- places orange markers upon random damage-dealers. After a brief delay, marked players will detonate via unavoidable AoE damage and leave behind a pulsing orb at their current locations (which will periodically explode in a large AoE radius). As a result, marked players should spread apart from each other (and the rest of the raid) to avoid overlapping the initial explosions. Once the orbs have been dropped, the entire raid should move away from their location seeing as they will soon begin to periodically unleash large AoE explosions until they expire.Prey Missile- places a noticeably large orange-red marker on a random damage dealer. After a brief delay, the marked target will suffer moderate damage and receive a flaming debuff.Missile Simulation- creates multiple missiles at various edges of the arena that will slowly begin to travel from one side to the other, leaving only a few gaps for players to weave through them. Any player hit by a missile will suffer moderate damage and debuffs, so avoid at all costs.Diffractive Plasma- unleashes unavoidable raid-wide AoE that will require heavy healing.Load Program- as mentioned before, the monitors outside of the arena will display an image that represents which program is being loaded. There are four possible programs - each being represented by a recognizable sprite ofDadaluma,Ultros,Air Force, andBibliotaph.In savage mode, the firstLoadwill involve either theDadaluma ProgramorBibliotaph Program. Rather than try to make an order from randomization, we'll explain all four programs in their entirety.Program MechanicsUnlike the normal version of Sigmascape V3.0, the monitors outside of the arena are far more involved in the encounter. While they still display sprites that represent upcoming mechanics, the Guardian will complicate matters by using various commands that interact with these programs. Commands include:Load (Program)- displays a program (sprite) on the monitor before unleashing a program-specific opening attack.Run (Program)- summons an add based on the program. For example, if the Guardian runs theBiblotaphprogram, then Bibliotaph will be summoned into the arena.Skip (Program)- causes the Guardian to completely skip the program being displayed on thebigscreen and run the program on thesmallscreen instead.Retrieve (Program)- causes the Guardian to retrieve andLoada previouslySkippedprogram (see above).Copy (Program)- causes the Guardian to make a copy of the currently active program which it will eventuallyPastelater in the encounter.Paste (Program)- causes the Guardian to utilize a previouslyCopiedprogram. Bear in mind thatPaste (Program)will not take place until the finale.Bear in mind that the presence of these program-related mechanics (and two possible phase-orders at the beginning of the battle) means that some loaded programs (displayed below) may not be executed in their entirety. For example, the Guardian may load one program, execute some opening attacks associated with it, thenRetrievea previously skipped program, pushing the fight into a different program prematurely. Also, multiple generic mechanics will take place regardless of any programs in effect.Program: DadalumaRepresented by a sprite of Dadaluma performing a flying kick.Load: Whenever theDadalumaprogram isloaded, players should expect a knockback in the form of a damaging shockwave. Bear in mind that being knocked into the outer walls of the arena will debilitate you with debuffs, so make sure to position yourself so that you remain inside the arena.Soon after beingLoaded, Guardian will unleash aMissile Simulation, causing the arena to fill with slow travelling missiles that must be avoided at all costs. At the same time,Chakra Burstwill spawn eight yellow circles within the arena - each one displaying a slowly descending orb (meteor mechanic), indicating that at least one player must be standing within each circle before the orbs hit the platform. If one (or more) circles are uninhabited by the time the orbs finally descend, the entire raid will suffer damage andDamage Downdebuffs (relative to how many orbs were uncaught). Unlike normal mode, players will need to soak the orbs whilst also avoiding theMissile Simulation.Run: SummonsDadalumainto a corner of the arena - an add that should immediately be picked up by the off-tank (and slain by the raid) as soon as possible. Whilst active, he will occasionally unleash anAura Cannon(straight-line AoE) towards a random player marked via a blue-icon.Aura Cannonwill initially be used against a random healer, followed by random damage dealers, and inflicts moderate damage and bleeds upon anyone hit.Program: UltrosRepresented by a sprite of Ultros, a carnivorous purple octopus and a long-running antagonist of the series.Load: Whenever theUltrosprogram is loaded, pools of ink will be dropped onto all members of the raid in the form of unavoidable and non-telegraphed AoE circles (unlike the telegraphed version in normal mode). As such, all players will need to spread apart from one another as soon as they notice theUltrosprogram being loaded to avoid overlapping damage onto fellow teammates. Bear in mind that the initial loading of theUltros Programis typically followed by aDiffractive Plasma(unavoidable raid-wide AoE), so be sure to heal people up as soon as the ink has dropped.After being inked,Tentacle Simulationwill cause four tentacles to emerge from beneath four random players (indicated by large AoE circles). Unlike normal mode, tentacles spawned during theUltrosprogram will eventually useWallopin the direction selected players are facing (rather than in a random fashion). As such, all players should group up in one location to bait the initial tentacle AoE circles whilst all facing in the same direction (so that the upcomingWallopattacks will be baited in a predictable direction).Wallop- which is a column AoE from each tentacle - has no telegraph and will outright slay any player unlucky enough to be caught in the attack.Run: SummonsUltrosinto a corner of the arena - an add that should immediately be picked up by the off-tank (and slain by the raid) as soon as possible. Whilst active,Ultroswill periodically attempt to castStoneskin- an absorb shield that will render him nigh unkillable if he succeeds. As such,Stoneskinshould be interrupted at all costs, as failure to do so will likely result inUltrossurviving long enough toenrageand wipe the raid via stacking self-buffs.Meanwhile, the Guardian will castAir Raid, becoming untargetable while floating above the arena, eventually targeting a random player withChain Cannon. Unlike normal mode, there is no tether or telegraph involved, but it can be safely baited by having the entire raid battleUltrosin the corner. By doing so, theChain Cannonwill predictably be used on that location, removing any guesswork. As soon asChain Cannonis about to be unleashed, all players (as a group) can simply move from one corner to the other whilst the Guardian bombards the previous corner. As soon asChain Cannonhas ended, the Guardian will utilizeMain Cannon, dropping aproximity markerat the previously bombarded location. Assuming you have already moved from one corner to the other after baitingChain Cannon, no further action is required - you will have already moved safely out of range, allowing more time to killUltros. However, don't forget to keep interruptingStoneskinalong the way!Program: Air ForceRepresented by a sprite of Air Force, a flying boss encountered duringFinal Fantasy VI.Load: Whenever theAir Forceprogram isloaded, the Guardian will unleash a point-blank AoE from its current location, forcing everyone in melee range to retreat to safety.Run: Summons fourAir Forceadds - one per corner - with each one tethering to a random damage dealer. After a brief delay, each add will aim a huge cone-shaped AoE (Diffractive Laser) towards their respective target which, once fired, will destroy any players caught in its wake. As a result, each damage dealer should make an effort to turn the add away from the raid and force the cannons to shoot harmlessly outside of the arena (rather than across it), preferably whilst attacking the add to kill it as soon as possible.Shortly after the flying adds have been dealt with,Bomb Deploymentwill create two defusable explosives within the arena - each one displaying a red and blue wire. To defuse a bomb, players must look to see which of the two colors is glowing brighter than the other and stand on that respective wire. However, should any player walk on the incorrect wire for any reason, the bomb will detonate prematurely, wiping the entire raid.Program: BibliotaphRepresented by a sprite of the Everliving Bibliotaph - essentially an imposing, walking book (for those who have not encountered Bibliotaph before).Load: Whenever theBibliotaphprogram isloaded, players should expect foursummoning circlesto appear within the arena, much like those encountered when facing Bibliotaph in theGreat Gubal Library. The raid will need to quickly 'close' these summoning circles as soon as possible. To do so, four players will need to stand within a summoning circle at the same time, which locks the portal, and then repeat this process for all remaining summoning circles. As such, dividing the raid in half (2x4) and having each group handle two circles each is the quickest method.Any summoning circles that remain unclosed after a while will eventually disperse, but not before spawning a vicious add that will join the fray.Run: SummonsBibliotaphinto a corner of the arena - an add that should immediately be picked up by the off-tank (and slain by the raid) as soon as possible. Whilst active,Bibliotaphwill periodically useThrub, a vicious tank-buster against its primary target for spicy damage.Phase 2: Virus Combat ProgramEssentially the second phase of the encounter, causing the entire raid to acquire a wide range of interacting debuffs that will need to be managed in various ways.Positive/Negative Charge- the entire raid will be debuffed with an even split of "+" or "-" (Positive/Negative) debuffs, and tethered into pairs. Some pairs will shareoppositecharged (+/-), meaning they will eventually be pulled together, whereas some other pairs will havelikecharges (such as +/+ or -/-, meaning they will eventually be pushed apart.Searing Wind- afflicts two pairs of players (withoppositecharges, meaning each pair will eventually be pulled together). One pair is composed of a tank and healer, and another pair is comprised of two damage dealers. Pairs affected withSearing Windwill periodically unleash massive AoEs at their location, inflicting unavoidable (minor) damage to themselves, but massive damage and knockbacks to anyone overlapped by the AoE. Also, due to theoppositecharges, both pairs will eventually be pulled closer together, risking further overlap. As a result, pairs affected bySearing Windneed to spread apart from each other (and move away from the raid) as soon as possible, preferably by standing in adjacent corners away from the boss. For example, one pair spread to the northeast and northwest, while the other pair spread to the southeast and southwest, leaving the center of the arena free for the rest of the raid. After periodically exploding (and eventually being pulled towards each other), thePositive/Negativetether will drop and one final tick ofSearing Windwill explode, allowing the pairs to safely rejoin the rest of the raid.Abandonment- afflicts two pairs of players (withlikecharges, meaning each pair will eventually be pushed apart). One pair is composed of a tank and healer, and another pair is comprised of two damage dealers. Pairs affected withAbandonmentneed to remain close to at least one other player at all times. If a player withAbandonmentends up alone for any reason, they will be afflicted withHysteria, causing them to lose control of their character, likely resulting in them walking into other mechanics or the outer wall itself. Seeing as the corners are being utilized to deal withSearing Wind, both pairs withAbandonmentshould stack together in the arena center so that, when pushed apart by theirlikecharges, they will remain next to another pushed player. By doing so, no player is left alone.Aether Rot- a transferable debuff that will be placed on a single player withAbandonment. IfAether Rotexpires, the debuff explodes, resulting in grisly death for all participants. When transferred, the debuff duration will reset, though it cannot be transferred to a player more than once, thus it will need to be passed between raid members in a controlled manner throughout the phase.Viral Weapon- onceAbandonmentandSearing Windhave resolved, the Guardian will utilize various generic mechanics before unleashingViral Weapon, removing theAether Rotdebuff and disorienting all players. while disoriented, a rotating pointer will spin overhead, and any attempt to move will cause the marker to cease spinning and move you in the direction being pointed at. Players will need to be extra careful as the Guardian will unleash various mechanics that must be avoided (such asDiffractive Laser,Air RaidandMain Cannon) - made difficult by having only partial control of your character.Diffractive Radar- causes the Guardian to scan the arena via a very noticeable green radar telegraph. Whilst the arena is being scanned, any player who moves for any reason will suffer high damage and be afflicted with paralysis. Bear in mind that this will only affect directional movement, not attacks or spell-casting, so all players are free to continue dealing damage so long as they remain in one spot.Phase 3: Paste ProgramTheVirus Combat Program(Phase 2) ends withPaste Program, causing the Guardian to paste one of the programs that wereCopiedduring the first phase of the battle. Due to there being only two possible paths for programs in the first phase,Paste Programwill either be theAir Force ProgramorUltros Program, followed byDadaluma Program > Bibliotaph ProgramorBibliotaph Program > Dadaluma Program, followed lastly byAir ForceorUltros(whichever wasn't used at the beginning of phase 3). Whilst the mechanics of each program remains the same, it will be chaotically peppered with additional mechanical overlaps, but nothing you haven't dealt with already. The hard enrage is a long cast ofExtermination Sequence.Loot15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsSigmascape Datalog v3.0Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDiamond Leg Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDiamond Head Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1Diamond Hand Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1Diamond Foot Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
