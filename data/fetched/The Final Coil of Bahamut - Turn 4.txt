NoticeAll Lv. 50 Bahamut raids do not appear in anyDuty Roulettesdue to their high difficulty (comparable to Savage). Therefore, attempting to queue throughDuty Finderwill result in extremely long queues. For an easy completion, it is recommended that players useParty Finderand form anUnrestricted Party(i.e., with level sync disabled). Players who wish to complete this duty with level sync enabled should also form a pre-made party, which also enables the use ofMinimum Item LevelandSilence Echosettings for an additional challenge.This article is about the level 50 challenge-moderaid.

This fight has a hard 14 minute enrage so players need to handle the fight as quickly as possible. The boss doesn't have very complex attacks so learning them well will be the key to success.Before the fight begins players need to set a marker somewhere in the arena to denote where players with a specific marker will stack to split damage.Once the boss is engaged, the edge around the arena becomes an instant-kill uponPhase 1: 100%-76%To begin the fight players should pull the boss to the south wall of the arena.Flare Breath: A large frontal cleave on the primary target. Be sure to turn the boss away from the party for this. This attack is usually paired with other attacks.Megaflare: 3-4 players are marked with ground AoEs. 3-4 other players will be hit with a splash damage AoE, and 2-4 players are marked for a beam that must be split by other marked players to mitigate the damage. Players with a marker should stack at the predetermined location. The boss will follow this with aFlare Breath.Flatten: A heavy damage tankbuster. Requires mitigation to survive. Followed by three casts ofFlare Breathso immediate heals afterwards or invulnerability are needed.Earth Shaker: Two players are tethered to the boss and marked with brown tethers. After a short delay, the tethered players will have a line fired at them that hits anything between them. The players will also drop three puddles each. To handle this, players who are tethered should move to the left and right of the boss and slowly move around the arena to avoid cleaving the party and drop the puddles around the edge. These puddles will persist for a while, so players should avoid standing in them.This phase will repeat until the boss reaches 76% HP. players should push this phase as hard as possible to give more time later to handle other phases. It is also recommended that players use a DPS Limit Break level 1 to push the phase and also have a tank Limit Break level 3 for a later phase.At 76% the boss will castGigaflare, an unavoidable room-wide attack. Mitigate and heal through the damage.Phase 2: 76%-52%Shadow of Meracydia: After theGigaflarecast fades aShadow of Meracydiaspawns in the north of the arena. If it gets too close to the boss, they will link and begin buffing each other. If the boss was pulled to the south, the off tank can grab the add and keep it in the north to avoid this. The other Adds will also spawn away from the boss, minimizing the chances of them tethering together.Players should focus on the add, as if it's not killed quickly, it will fire a line of puddles at a player, severely restricting how freely players can move.Flare Star: At the same time theShadow of Meracydiaspawns, the boss will summon orbs to tether to players that move slowly at first, then will speed towards the player they are tethered to. If a player is hit by an orb, they will take damage and receive a stack of the debuffSuffocated Will. This debuff will deal more damage when applied based on how many stacks a player already has. Non-tank players should not receive more than 2 stacks, as the damage will be lethal after that. Communication is required between players to note who has orbs tethered to them and who needs someone to take their tether.The boss will follow up with aFlatten, but only followed by one cast ofFlare Breathand thenMegaflare. This time however, theMegaflarewill spawn a pillar from one of its AoEs, which will explode and wipe the raid if not dealt with. A single player must stand in the AoE and soak the damage instead, preventing the wipe.Rage of Bahamut: Deals damage based on how many stacks ofSuffocated Willa player has. Healers should be ready for raid-wide healing after this.From here the phase repeats, an add will spawn in the southeast and west and the mechanics will keep repeating until the boss reaches 52% HP. At this time the boss will cast anotherGigaflareand leave the arena.Phase 3: AddsDivebomb: Players should move to the center of the room immediately after the boss leaves the arena. It will appear at the edge of the arena and mark a random player with a red circle above their head. This indicates the boss will charge from where it is to the other side of the arena, passing through where the marked player was standing. AStorm of Meracydiawill spawn at the edge as well and mark a player with a green marker, indicating the same thing. Once these markers go out, players know the boss and the add will charge through the center of the arena in a straight line, creating safe zones. Once the green marker comes up players can move to those safe zones to avoid the attack. Be aware that the paths of the attacks are rather wide, so move sufficiently into safe zones. The boss will follow this up with aMegaflare, thus it is important to not stack in the chaos of dodging the divebomb. It's wise to have half the players dodge the divebomb to the right and the other half to the left (of looking at Bahamut from the middle) to give space for each player to spread.Adds will spawn after this, aPain of Meracydiaand aBlood of Meracydia. The off tank should pull the Pain to the west of the room, while the main tank grabs the Blood and the party quickly burns it down. TheBlood of Meracydiawill switch between a buff that mitigates physical damage and magic damage. Players should pay attention to which buff the boss has up and try to line bursts up with these buffs. ThePain of Meracydiahas a strong cleave attack that needs to be pointed away from the party and usesTail Swipe, attacking behind it. Avoid this by attacking from its side as much as possible and being careful with positionals.Gusts of Meracydiawill also spawn. The tank that grabbed the Blood should grab these, as if they get too close to the Pain, they will be absorbed, and it will receive HP back and aDamage Upbuff.After the Pain and Blood are finished off, 2Sins of Meracydiawill spawn. These Adds hit hard and should be defeated quickly. Each tank should grab them and pull them into the center of the arena to be burned down by AoE attacks. At roughly 20 seconds after spawning, they will castEvil Eye, an attack that deals damage equal to their remaining HP. Shortly after this another round ofDivebombsfrom the boss and theStorm of Meracydia. These should be handled the same way as the previous attack.Storm of Meracydiawill spawn in the center of the room and should be pulled to the south of the room. The tank that does this will also grab the Gusts that spawn later. The other tank will pick up the rest of the Adds as they spawn and pull them over to where the Storm is to burn everything down efficiently. When the Pain respawns, keep it pulled away from the group until the Gusts are defeated. After the Storm is defeated, it will drop aNeurolink 2.0Puddle, which when stepped in greatly reduces damage dealt.Teraflare: After enough time has past, Bahamut will appear on the northern side of the arena and slowly begin casting it's ultimate attack. To withstand it, players must be prepared to perform two actions. First, the Pain must be defeated before the cast finishes, as theNeurolinkpuddle debuffs withFlare Dampening, greatly mitigating the damage from this attack. Secondly, the tank should use a Limit Break 3 to further mitigate damage; a countdown will appear when 10 seconds remain, and the Limit Break should generally be used at 4 seconds remaining. Healers can also use shields.After the party survivesTeraflare, Bahamut will return to the arena and begin the final phase.Phase 4: 52%-0%The boss will use the attacksFlare Breath,Megaflare,Earthshaker, andGigaflarein this phase, each with a slight change to their mechanics; see below for details. The boss also adds a new ability to its repertoire.Akh Morn: A multi-hit tank buster. This attack also tethers to a player, and if they are in range of the blast, will split the damage of the attack. The off tank should pick this tether up and stand near the main tank for this attack. The first hit ofAkh Mornwill deal heavy damage, with each hit after dealing about half as much as the first. Every time the boss uses this attack, it will add an additionalAkh Mornhit.Megaflare: The attack mechanics will happen as normal, however this time up to 2 pillars will spawn, each needing a player to stand in them and soak the damage. Players will also be tethered randomly and hit byTempest Wing, a twister that deals moderate damage. If anyone else is hit by this, they are knocked back, take damage and receive a heavy damage over time debuff. This attack can knock players into the edge of the arena, spelling instant death for anyone who touches it. The off and main tank should pick up these tethers and subsequently stand far enough to not hit each other with the twisters. This is so that the originally targeted players can stack for Megaflare if needed.Earthshaker: This attack behaves as normal, however the boss will also tether the two players targeted withEarthshakerwithTempest Wing, causing twisters to spawn on them. Targeted players should not move into other players while the twister is active and healers should be ready to heal them. The boss also follows up with aFlare Breathimmediately after. These mechanics will repeat from here.After every two rounds of the above rotation, the boss will useGigaflare, and immediately follow up withAkh Mornso be ready to move, mitigate and heal through this.This repeats until the boss is either defeated or enrages. At its enrage, it casts a 15-secondGigaflarethat will wipe the party.Solo strategyAs ofpatch 6.0, the duty can be easily cleared solo by any well-geared level 90 character.The boss fight consists of attacking the boss and the adds it spawns until they die. The only danger lies in the three phases in which the boss and its add charge through the arena; they must be carefully evaded or they will push the player out of the arena and to their death.LootSee also:Dreadwyrm WeaponsBahamut Prime30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsBurning AuricleDrops directly from boss, must besyncedTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPaladin's Dreadwyrm Arms (IL 135)OtherN/ACBlue1Dreadwyrm BardicheMarauder's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm ClaymoreDark Knight's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm SpearLancer's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm ClawsPugilist's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm KatanaSamurai's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm DaggersRogue's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm LongbowArcher's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm HandgonneMachinist's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm StaffTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm GrimoireArcanist's Grimoire135CBlue1Dreadwyrm RapierRed Mage's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm CodexScholar's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm TorquetumAstrologian's Arm135CBlue1Dreadwyrm Weapon Coffer (IL 135)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDreadwyrm Chest Gear Coffer (IL 130)OtherN/AABasic1Neo Aetherstone - Body GearMaterialN/AABasic1Faded Copy of AnswersOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchOut of a Bind I5Completethe Final Coil of Bahamut.Wind-up Louisoix2.4Out of a Bind II10Completethe Final Coil of Bahamut5 times.-2.4Out of a Bind III20Completethe Final Coil of Bahamut10 times.-2.4Mightier than the Dreadwyrm5Completethe Final Coil of Bahamut - Turn 4with a party of onlyblue mages,Silence Echoturned on, andUnrestricted Partyturned off.-5.15DialogueIntro CutsceneAlisaie:'Twas a long and arduous road, but at last we reach its end.Alisaie:Farewell, Bahamut. I banish you back to the aether!Alisaie:He is not yet whole! I did not think him capable...Alphinaud:Ugh... Alisaie! ALISAIE!Alisaie:I had thought it finally over...Alisaie:We'll not survive another blast!Alisaie:No... Is this how I honor my promise to Grandfather?Lousioix:You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm—your own meaning in this sea of chaos. Will you do that for me?Alisaie:I will, Grandfather. In fact, I believe I already have.Alisaie:That reason has been with me all along, guiding me—Eorzea's blade of Light, shearing through the endless shrouds of darkness...Alisaie:I have been shown the miraculous feats of which we are all capable. Of whichIam capable.Alisaie:Bahamut! You have wreaked enough havoc!Alisaie:I will not let your wrathful fires consume all that we know and love!Alisaie:Ugh!Alphinaud:How long I have waited to hear you say that! You have found your resolve at last!Alphinaud:Let me join my strength to yours.Alphinaud:In this place, in this moment, our purpose has become one!Alphinaud and Alisaie:For the future of Eorzea!Alisaie:This last task is yours, Warrior of Light! You must destroy Bahamut's crystal core!Post-duty CutsceneAlisaie:You did it!Alisaie:But one task remains...Alisaie:With this last coil disabled, there shall be naught left to bind Bahamut to this world. His beloved children will finally know peace...Alisaie:'Tis done. He is truly gone.Alisaie:You knew, didn't you? You knew what Grandfather had become.Alphinaud:I...was not certain. But from all I had gleaned, it seemed a distinct possibility.Alphinaud:The scene people describe of the Battle of Cartenau was one of unimaginable devastation. And 'tis through the combined prayers of the desperate—and an abundant source of aether—that primals are born. I merely put two and two together.Alisaie:And you consider that a sufficient explanation?Alisaie:Well, however you stumbled across your theory, 'twas this revelation that made you wary of my attachment to Grandfather.Alisaie:You feared that in my obsession, I would fall under his primal sway. Is that why you decided to join us? To pull me back should I show signs of wavering?Alphinaud:Pray forgive me, Sister. I wished only to protect you. Yet I see now that I needn't have doubted the strength of your conviction.Alphinaud:May I ask you a question? What do you now intend to do with the truth you have uncovered?Alisaie:Which particular truth was that, Brother? The fact that desperate prayer gave rise to the primal Phoenix? That this new god was responsible for setting Eorzea on the path to rebirth?Alisaie:Should such a tale become common knowledge, people would soon offer up their prayers in earnest—they would beseech Phoenix to complete the healing that was begun.Alphinaud:Yet as you and I know all too well, the very act of calling forth this savior would do more harm to the land than good.Alphinaud:We cannot encourage such worship for this very reason. Were Grandfather forced to return as an aether-draining primal, 'twould undo all that he had worked to protect.Alphinaud:Your abiding love for him was the key that unlocked the truth of the Calamity.Alphinaud:But keys may also serve to seal doors that were best left unopened.Alphinaud:Let your love now guide your actions, and lock away deep inside the fate of both Grandfather and Bahamut.Alisaie:Fear not, Alphinaud—I understand what must be done.Alisaie:The realm need not know the truth for it to be saved.Alisaie:That the elder primal is banished, to return to more...that is enough.Alisaie:Let us make our way back to the surface.
