The raid is also known asO6S.Contents1Strategy1.1Chadarnook1.2General Mechanics2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 2StrategyChadarnookYou find yourself within in a square-shaped art gallery surrounded by mysterious paintings, one of which is haunted by a Chadarnook - a ghostly spectre that harnesses power by possessing paintings that represent various elements. You'll also notice four blank canvases on the ground which, when stood on, can be interacted with using theChocobo Brush(duty action) to prepare for upcoming attacks. Unlike normal mode, each canvas will require players to fill them with specific paint colours (which are also present around the arena).You will also notice four distinct paintings propped up in each corner of the arena that represents various elements - a giant rock (earth), a wall of flame (fire), an undersea scape (water), and a swirling green vortex (wind) - as well as one large portrait outside of the arena that representsThe Goddess. Unlike normal mode,The Goddesswill also possess paintings at the same time as the Chadarnook, forcing the raid to react to mechanics depending on which paintings are being possessed (and by whom).DespiteThe Goddessbeing outside of the painting (instead of auto-attacking players from within the painting like normal mode), both tanks will still be receiving vicious auto-attacks throughout the encounter, so be wary!Below is a list of all mechanics encountered during the battle and how to deal with them.General MechanicsDemonic Howl- an unavoidable raid-wide AoE that blasts the raid once Chadarnook emerges.Demonic Shear- a nasty tank-buster against Chadarnook's primary target. Be sure to mitigate the blast with cooldowns whenever possible.Possession (Demon-Fire) + (Goddess-Wind)- Goddess & Chadarnook approach the centre of the arena and will noticeably begin to tether themselves to theFirepainting (Chadarnook) andWindpainting (Goddess). All players will need to use theirChocobo Brush(duty action) on the canvas directly in front of theFirepainting to acquire aFire ResistusingBlue Paint. Eventually, the Chadarnook will unleash a waft of unavoidable fire damage upon the raid, slaying anyone who did not acquire the resistance buff in time. Meanwhile, a cyclonic circle of green wind will also appear at the north of the arena, containing a stack marker. After acquiring theFire Resistbuff, all players will need to stack inside the stack-marker to absorb upcoming damage from the Goddess.Once both mechanics have resolved, the Chadarnook will unleash anotherDemonic Howl(unavoidable raid-wide AoE), thus healers should ensure that the raid is healthy beforehand.Poltergeist- the Goddess summons aReaper(add) which will automatically tether itself to a random healer. Whilst tethered, theReaperwill move towards the chosen healer whenever they are not looking directly at the add. If theReapergets too close to the tethered healer, they will immediately be slain, thus Healers must keep an eye on theReaper(literally) whenever possible to keep stop it from moving.Simultaneously, Chadarnook will unleash anotherDemonic Shear'(tank-buster), whilst the Goddess invokesDivine Lure- agaze-attack- forcing the raid to look away from her. Seeing as theReaperwill advance towards its tethered healer when they look away, they should only turn their back at the last possible moment, then immediately turn to face theReaperonce again.Shortly afterDemonic ShearandDivine Lurehave resolved, theReaperwill vanish, followed by anotherDemonic Howl(raid-wide AoE damage).Demonic Pain- tethers all players together into pairs. After a moderate delay, each pair of tethered players will take damage depending on how close they were to their partner. Seeing as tethers are proximity-based -- if a tethered pair are close to each other, the tether will be bright-pink, whereas if they move far enough apart, the tether will be shown as dark purple. By distancing yourself until the tether turns purple, players will take minimal damage, whereas anyone with pink tethers will take far greater damage. In short, simply move away from your chosen partner for the best result. As soon asDemonic Painresolves, Chadarnook will unleash yet anotherDemonic Howl(blast of raid-wide AoE).Release- indicated by the Chadarnook and Goddess moving to the centre of the arena and releasing themselves from previously chosen paintings, indicating that another painting-combo is imminent.Possession (Demon-Wind) + (Goddess-Earth)- Goddess & Chadarnook approach the centre of the arena and will noticeably begin to tether themselves to theWindpainting (Chadarnook) andEarthpainting (Goddess). After a brief delay, the Goddess will create large circle AoE's underneath all members of the raid simultaneously, whilst the Chadarnook summons cyclonic orbs around the arena that will eventually detonate via huge AoE explosions. Thankfully, the earth-AoE's can be baited into one location by having the raid stack in one location and then moving out of the spawned circles as soon as they appear. Similarly to normal mode, at least one player will also need to use a canvas to summon a mini-mount and use it to blow the windy orbs away from the rest of the raid before they explode. To do so, players will need to usePink Painton the appropriate canvas, then use the mini mounts pet ability.As a rule of thumb, have the entire raid stack near the needed canvas so that a designated player can acquire the mini-mount, all while baiting the earthen AoE circles. Once the circles have spawned, all players can then move beside the boss whilst the designated player uses the mini-mount to blow any problematic wind-orbs away from the raid's chosen location, allowing everyone else to maintain up-time on the boss throughout the combo. Bear in mind that the Chadarnook will also unleash aDemonic Shear(tank-buster) at its primary target throughout the ordeal, followed by yet anotherDemonic Howl(raid-wide AoE blast).Last Kiss- the Goddess applies an orange marker to a random damage dealer that will eventually apply a transferableLast Kissdebuff to the chosen victim. Once the debuff expires, the player carrying it will suffer tremendous damage in an AoE around them. Seeing as the debuff itself can be transferred to other players, it is wise for the marked damage dealer to give the debuff to the off-tank, allowing them to mitigate the upcoming damage (away from the rest of the raid), leaving the main-tank free to deal with the Chadarnook itself.OnceLast Kisshas resolved, the Chadarnook will unleash anotherDemonic Howl(raid-wide AoE), and the Goddess will summon anotherPoltergeist(reaper add) before executing anotherDivine Lure(gaze attack) - both of which are dealt with in the same manner as before. Before the next mechanic takes place, the Chadarnook will bombard its main target with yet anotherDemonic Shear(tank-buster).Demonic Storm- creates a stack-up marker on a random target, forcing the raid to group up and absorb the damage, followed by anotherDemonic Howl(blast of raid-wide damage).Possession (Demon-Fire) + (Demon-Earth) + (Goddess-Water)- Goddess & Chadarnook approach the centre of the arena and will noticeably begin to tether themselves to theFirepainting (Chadarnook),Earthpainting (also Chadarnook), andWaterpainting (Goddess) for a triple-painting combo. Just like before, all members of the raid will need to acquire theFire Resistancebuff by usingBlue Painton the appropriate canvas, then collectBlack Paintand use it on the canvas in front of theEarth Paintingto summon Air-Force mini-mounts, allowing all players to elevate off the floor during an upcoming seismic earthquake.Meanwhile, the Goddess (having possessed theWater Painting) will eventually smash the arena with rectangle-shaped blasts of water at a diagonal angle, leaving very few (and very thin) safe-spots in the very corners of the arena. The easiest method is to grab theFire Resistancebuff, hop on an Air-Force mini-mount and stack by the earth-painting itself, which is very close to where players acquire the Air-Force mount anyway.Materialize- similar to normal mode, the Chadarnook will now create a clone of itself which will utilize various painting mechanics in combination with the original. Whilst cloning itself, players will need to deal with anotherDemonic Pain(tethered pairs).Lullaby- the Goddess applies debuffs to all members of the raid, draining their resources periodically (MP & TP) and reducing their healing received. The Chadarnook will then compound the problem by repeatedly usingDemonic Howl(raid-wide AoE). To remove the debuff, players will need to use all available colours of paint to fill theSirencanvas in the middle of the arena.Once summoned, the Siren'sSong of Braverywill wash away the debuff, allowing healing to be received in full and to restore all drained MP & TP to the raid. Seeing as four colours are required to fill the Siren's canvas, it is wise to assign four players to the task, with each one grabbing a needed colour each. Bear in mind that the Chadarnook will useDemonic Shearduring this time, peppering its main target with a tank-buster.Prey- repeatedly bombards two random damage dealers with a continuous wave of small AoE shockwaves that will follow their movements. Targeted players should keep on the move until the effect expires, as standing still will result in constant damage. After marking two targets withPrey, the Goddess will useLast Kisson a random player once more, whilst the Chadarnook unleashes yet anotherDemonic Howl(raid-wide AoE). Don't forget to transfer theLast Kissdebuff to the off-tank!Possession (Demon-Wind) + (Demon-Water) + (Goddess-Earth)- Goddess, Chadarnook, and its clone, approach the centre of the arena and will noticeably begin to tether themselves to theWindpainting (Chadarnook),Waterpainting (also Chadarnook), andEarthpainting (Goddess) for another triple-painting combo. Just like the last time Goddess possessed the earth painting, all players will eventually spawn a massive earthen AoE circle beneath their feet which can be baited by stacking up.Whilst dealing with the upcoming AoE's, players will also need to useYellow Paintto summon aBoulderfrom the canvas in front of theWaterpainting, using this to hide from an upcoming flash-flood. Once the boulder has been summoned, simply hide behind the boulder until the water recedes. Then, thanks to the cyclonic orbs being summoned from the demonicWindpainting,Pink Paintwill once again be needed to summon the appropriate mini-mount, which one player will use to blow the windy orbs away from the rest of the raid. Before the wind-orbs explode, the Chadarnook will unleash yet anotherDemonic Howl(raid-wide AoE), so be wary!Demonic Spout + Flash Gale- the Chadarnook will use its chosen painting to spawn two sets of AoE circles beneath the players' feet (similar to the earth-painting version, except twice in a row and will smaller AoE circles). Meanwhile, the Chadarnook clone will prepare aFlash Galestack-up marker (similar toDemonic Stormfrom earlier). Due to all players spawning AoE circles beneath their feet, players should bait the two sets of AoE circles as a group, preferably by moving from one side of the boss to the other (allowing you to maintain uptime). Once the AoE's have resolved, players are free to stand still to absorb the stack-marker.As soon as both mechanics have resolved, the raid will contend with yet anotherDemonic Pain(paired tethers) andDemonic Howl(raid-wide damage), while the clone uses theWater Paintingto unleash another diagonal flash-flood across the arena, similar to the previous version used by the Goddess. To avoid, make sure you are standing in a corner (opposite the water painting).Possession (Demon-Fire) + (Demon-Earth) + (Goddess-Wind)- Goddess & Chadarnook approach the centre of the arena and will noticeably begin to tether themselves to theFirepainting (Chadarnook),Earthpainting (also Chadarnook), andWindpainting (Goddess) for a triple-painting combo. All participants will need to acquire theFire Resistancebuff by usingBlue Painton the appropriate canvas, then collectBlack Paintand use it on the canvas in front of theEarth Paintingto summon Air-Force mini-mounts, allowing all players to elevate off the floor during an upcoming seismic earthquake.Meanwhile, just like the very first possession at the start of the battle, a cyclonic circle of green wind will appear at the north of the arena, containing a stack marker. After acquiring theFire Resistbuff and acquiring Air-Force mini-mounts, be sure to group inside the stack-marker to absorb upcoming damage from the Goddess. This healing-intensive moment is followed by yet anotherDemonic Howl(raid-wide damage), followed byDemonic Shear(tank-buster), so healers should remain on their toes throughout.Materialize- summons the Chadarnook clone next to theEarth Paintingwhilst the Goddess usesPoltergeistto summon anotherReaper, tethering it to a random healer (and dealt with in the same way as before). Just like all previousPoltergeistcasts, the raid will need to turn their back to avoid aDivine Lure(gaze-attack), except this time, two random targets will also be dealing withPrey- the seismic AoE's that follow their movements.Demonic Howlwill then bombard the raid with even more unavoidable damage, followed byDemonic Shear(tank-buster),Demonic Pain(tethered pairs), anotherDemonic Howl(raid-wide AoE).Possession (Demon-Wind) + (Demon-Water) + (Goddess-Earth)- Goddess, Chadarnook, and its clone, approach the centre of the arena and will noticeably begin to tether themselves to theWindpainting (Chadarnook),Waterpainting (also Chadarnook), andEarthpainting (Goddess) - a combination you have dealt with not too long ago.In summary -- players will once again drop massive AoE's at their current location which can be baited for positional ease. UtilizeYellow Paintto summon aBoulderfrom the canvas in front of theWaterpainting and hide from an upcoming flash-flood, whilst also usingPink Paintto summon a mini-mount that can be used to blow away the windy orbs once the watery attack has receded. Like most mechanics, it will be followed by yet anotherDemonic Howl(raid-wide AoE).Assuming the fight has reached this point and the Chadarnook is still active, it will eventually long-cast an(Enraged) Demonic Howlto wipe the entire raid.Loot15Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsSigmascape Datalog v2.0Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDiamond Head Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1Diamond Hand Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1Diamond Foot Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDiamond Head Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1Diamond Hand Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1Diamond Foot Gear Coffer (IL 370)OtherN/AABasic1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
