Here is the cleaned up text for the strategy guide on The Whorleater (Hard) trial in Final Fantasy 14:

Strategy
Lord of the Whorl: Leviathan

Phase 1
The boss will begin at the head of the ship. Players can attack the boss until either enough time passes or the boss reaches 90%. Once the boss reaches either of these thresholds, it will become untargetable and dive under the water. Players need to watch for a large spume of water on either side of the ship, indicating where the boss's head will appear. For this first phase, the boss will always appear on the west side of the north end of the arena. The boss will use Body Slam, rearing up and slamming down into the deck, stunning all players and causing them to slide to that end of the ship. Players caught under the boss will take some damage. The boss will then become targetable, with its tail appearing at the opposite end of the ship.

Phase 2
Leviathan's Head and Leviathan's Tail are both targetable and mirror each other's HP. The head is covered by Veil of the Whorl that reflects Physical Ranged damage, while the tail's Veil of the Whorl reflects Magic damage. Casters should focus on the head, ranged players on the tail, and melee can target either. The tail will only cast Scale Darts on its main enmity target. The head has several attacks:

- Dread Tide: A Water elemental tankbuster on the main enmity target.
- Aqua Breath: A point-blank AoE attack that deals medium damage. 
- Water Spout: Cast on random players, deals medium damage.
- Tidal Roar: Unavoidable party-wide damage.

During this phase, the boss will summon Wavespine Sahagins in sets of two. If not dealt with quickly, they will spam cast Hydroshot, dropping large AoE puddles that debuff players with Dropsy, increasing vulnerability to Water attacks. 

The boss will also summon Gyre Spumes in sets of four. These drain points from the Elemental Converter and must be prioritized to avoid a party wipe from Tidal Wave.

The boss will sometimes dive under the water, signaling a side change with a water spout. Move to the opposite end of the ship to avoid damage.

At about 60%, the boss will leap over the ship and use Grand Fall, dropping an AoE that debuffs players with Heavy. The boss will then jump from end to end using Spinning Dive, dealing heavy damage and knockback. Run to the end with the Elemental Converter to activate it and avoid a wipe from Tidal Wave. The boss will then Body Slam and the fight continues.

Phase 3
The fight continues as before, but the boss will use Grand Fall occasionally and move from one end to the other, appearing on random sides. Wavetooth Sahagins will be summoned, casting Ruin and Dreadstorm which drops an AoE that debuffs players with Hysteria, causing loss of control. Prioritize killing these adds. Wavespine Sahagins will also continue to spawn.

Repeat these mechanics until the boss is defeated.
