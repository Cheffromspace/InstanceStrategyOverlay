Dialogue:

Varshahn: How long do you suppose she will remain this way?

Y'shtola: I haven't the faintest inkling, nor can I say whether the aether we can afford to share will be enough to awaken her. 'Twould be best to take her back with us to the Source. There, she would be guaranteed all she requires.

Varshahn: Zero cannot give her consent, but it seems we have no choice. The alternative would be to leave her here, defenseless. Should she later desire it, we can bring her home.

Varshahn: [Forename], might I ask you to hold on to Barbariccia's memoria? It may yet serve a purpose.

(After speaking with the deserter voidsent)

Varshahn: I trust you understand that once we leave the Thirteenth, we will not return until we are prepared to resume our search. Knowing this, are you ready to depart?

(Back in Radz-at-Han)

Varshahn: Our mission took many an unexpected turn. I am relieved that we have all returned safely. But before you all enjoy the rest you have earned a dozen times over, I would consult you on one last matter.

Estinien: Zero.

Varshahn: While she appears none the worse for wear, she remains locked in slumber, and I cannot help but worry. Is there aught we can do to expedite her recovery? If her aether is exhausted, perhaps I can share some of mine now...

Y'shtola: In the wastelands of the Thirteenth, one can only replenish aether by taking it from others, be it by trade or by force. In contrast, the Source is rich in ambient aether. Simply being here and drawing breath, Zero will absorb what she needs. She will awaken in time, and when she does, give her something to eat. Judging by her form, she should also be able to derive nourishment from food.

Varshahn: Food can certainly be arranged.

Y'shtola: Zero said before that Zenos had altered her essence. A change wrought, I suspect, with the power of Darkness. It acted upon the part of her that is voidsent, rendering it dominant. Thus we were able to reverse it with the power of Light.

Varshahn: 'Tis no exaggeration to say that Zero has proven herself invaluableâ”€a boon from Hydaelyn Herself. Her cooperation may come at a price, but whatever it is, I am willing to pay it. Exhausting though it may be at times.
