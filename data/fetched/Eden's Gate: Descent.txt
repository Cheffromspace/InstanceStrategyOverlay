Your celebrations are short-lived, however, as Ryne detects the presence of unknown enemies making their way towards Eden's core. While Thancred and Urianger rush to intercept a swarm of foes approaching from inside, you head to the upper reaches to face the threat from the above.— In-game descriptionEden's Gate: Descentis a level 80raidintroduced inpatch 5.01withShadowbringers.

However, should any participant fall, they can be raised after a moderate delay.Phase 1Doomvoid Guillotinecreates a massive straight line AoE directly through Voidwalker across the full length of the arena (relative to its current position and the direction it is facing). In short, the line will always be through the back/front of Voidwalker. After a brief delay, anyone standing in the reddish telegraph will sustain moderate damage and debuffs.Nyx Demonswill spawn along theGuillotineline, side-by-side, with each consecutive demon facing opposite directions. For example, if Voidwalker is in the centre of the arena (facing north) andGuillotinewas cast through its north/south side, thenNyxwill form in that line shortly afterwards, facing east, west, east, west, etc. After a brief delay, the demons will begin traversing in the direction they are facing until they leave the arena, inflicting damage and debuffs unto anyone caught in their path.Doomvoid Sliceris a vicious donut AoE centred on Voidwalker. After a brief delay, anyone not standing directly in Voidwalker's hitbox will be sliced for moderate damage and debuffs. However, if Voidwalker is being tanked at the far end of the arena, there is usually enough space for players to avoid this simply by standing on the opposite side of the platform as well.Nyx Demonswill once again spawn, only this time, they take on the shape of the donut AoE (ie. circular - one north, east, west and south of Voidwalker). After a brief delay, they will travel towards where the boss initially castDoomvoid Slicer, inflicting damage and debuffs on anyone they collide with during their travel. Once they collide with each other, they will disperse.NOTE:Nyx Demons will always be summoned after each and every cast ofDoomvoid Guillotine/Slicer.Shadowflameis a vicious tank-buster that will hit both the main target and off-tank simultaneously. As a result, both tanks should be ready to mitigate whenever necessary.Dark Fire IIIplaces large AoE markers on four random players, forcing them to spread out to avoid damaging teammates with their incoming AoE damage.Dark Fire IIIis noticeable by the AoE circles (and icon above the victims head) taking on a reddish-pink hue. After a brief delay,Dark Fire IIIexplodes, dealing high damage to its victims and anyone else caught in the blast(s).Unholy Darknessplaces a stack-marker on a random player, forcing the team to group together in order to help absorb as much damage as possible.Phase 2Spell In Waitingwill now be showcased. When cast, the next ability used by Voidwalker will become delayed. Abilities delayed in this manner will gain a new marker - a circle containing the icon of the delayed spell - along with a clock-like aesthetic, as well as a ticking timer that counts down when the ability is about to detonate. As you can imagine, this will lead to various mechanic combos that may trick players into reacting too early.Dark Fire III (In Waiting)- casts the same pink-red AoE markers and icons onto four random players just like before, except this time, a clock-like animation displays that this spell isIn Waiting. Rather than exploding after a brief delay like its original version, it will only explode when theIn Waitingtimer has completed, indicated by a 5-second countdown animation within the clock-like icon over each victims head. This first cast will not overlap with any other mechanics, essentially serving as a micro-tutorial of what to expect.Unholy Darkness (In Waiting)- casts the stack-marker from earlier, except this time, it will beIn Waiting, gaining the same clock-like icon. Instead of being executed after a brief delay, it will only detonate when the marked player's timer counts down. Just like the aboveDark Fire III, this delayed version ofUnholy Darknesswill not overlap with any other mechanics - another mini-tutorial of what is to come.Dark Fire III (In Waiting) + Unholy Darkness (In Waiting)will now test the group. Voidwalker, after casting a delayedDark Fire III(4x Pink-Red AoE markers), will also cast adelayedstack marker. For this first overlap, both spells will go off simultaneously, so players with the AoE marker should spread out away from the group, whereas anyone without an AoE marker should bunch up to help absorb the stack-marker.Entropycauses Voidwalker to unleash a vicious barrage of unavoidable raid-wide damage that should be healed or shielded through.Hand of Ereboswill now spawn at the eastern or western edge of the arena. After a moderate delay, the menacing hand will eventually hit the platform and knock people in the direction it is facing (as indicated by an arena-wide telegraph that displays arrows pointing in the knockback direction). All participants should move as close to the hand as possible (without falling off the platform) to avoid being punted over the edge to their doom. Additionally, knockback from theHand of Ereboscan also be avoided by utilizingknockback immunitycooldowns.Doomvoid Guillotinewill once again be cast through Voidwalker in the direction it is facing - indicated by the massive straight-line AoE across the platform. Simply move out of the telegraph to avoid, though bear in mind,Nyx Demonswill be summoned along the line after it has detonated and must be avoided just like before.Hand of Ereboswill spawn at the same time as theNyx Demons, forcing players to avoid the flying creatures while navigating towards theHand of Erebosto avoid being knocked off the platform.Doomvoid Slicer- the donut AoE from earlier - will be cast once more, forcing all participants to move into Voidwalkers hitbox. Bear in mind thatNyx Demonswill be spawned afterward and must be avoided, just like earlier.Shadowflame- the tank-buster against both tanks simultaneously - will be cast once more, followed by anotherEntropy(the unavoidable raid-wide AoE). Tanks and Healers, be ready!Punishing Rayspawns multiple pulsating pools around the arena. Visually, you will eventually see objects floating from the sky towards each puddle, much like meteor mechanics. Once the objects touch the ground, any pool that isn't sealed (i.e. doesn't have a player standing within it) will emit unavoidable damage and inflict vicious debuffs upon the raid. However, standing within a pool will also inflict a nastybleedfor as long you remain inside.Unholy Darkness (In Waiting)- casts the stack-marker from earlier with theIn Waitingdelay whilst the group is standing withinPunishing Raypools, baiting players into leaving too early in order to stack. Instead, the raid should wait untilPunishing Rayhas concluded before moving.However, Voidwalker will then castDark Fire III (In Waiting)in an attempt dissuade players from stacking up forUnholy Darkness. Do not be fooled! Instead, all participants should remain stacked untilUnholy Darkness(stack) has been concluded, then move away from the group to avoid clipping teammates with the delayedDark Fire III(AoE circles).Hand of ErebosandPunishing Raywill be cast in unison, forcing players to move towards the hand (or utilizeknockback immunity) to avoid being pushed off the platform, then scramble to stand within the pulsating pools and seal them beforePunishing Rayconcludes.Entropywill once again blast the entire raid with unavoidable damage.Shadow Eyeplaces a 'look away' marker on a player, indicated by a purple icon in the shape of an open eye. Only those who are looking directly at the targeted player when the spell has been activated will be affected by its detrimental effects; thus players must ensure they have their back to the marked player when it goes off. Failure to look away from the target when it goes off willPetrifythem, rendering them unable to move for a considerable amount of time.Shadow Eye (In Waiting)places the 'look away' marker on another player along with theIn Waitingtimer. The raid must be ready to turn away from the effected player once the 5-second timer begins counting down. However, various mechanics will take place beforeShadow Eye (In Waiting)is executed, such as:Doomvoid Guillotine- another straight line-AoE through Voidwalker in the direction it is facing, followed by the summoning of moreNyx Demonsalong the line after it has detonated, all of which must be avoided in the same manner as before.Doomvoid Slicer- the donut AoE from earlier - will be cast once more, except this time, it will overlap with the upcomingShadow Eye (In Waiting), forcing all participants to move into Voidwalkers hitbox (or to the other end of the arena if Voidwalker is being tanked near the north or south edge, whilst also avoiding the gaze of theShadow Eyetarget. Bear in mind thatNyx Demonswill still be spawned and must be avoided.If you have gotten this far, all the previous mechanics will repeat on a loop until Voidwalker (or the raid) is slain.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityHelm of Early AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Armor of Early AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Greaves of Early AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Bangle of Early AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityGauntlets of Early AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Chausses of Early AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Greaves of Early AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Bangle of Early AntiquityOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 3NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityForce Your Way Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1DialogueVoidwalker: By my hand, the veil between our worlds is torn open!
