Bosses:

Magitek Rearguard
- Cermet Pile - Tankbuster. Avoid facing towards the group as it cleaves.
- Garlean Fire - Fires a line of circles. Dodge to the side of the circle. There's an arrow indicator showing where it will go. Later uses two lines side by side. 
- Rearguard Bit - Lined up on the edge firing a narrow line attack across the arena. Occasionally ones next to each other will fire together for a wider beam.
- Rearguard Mine - Small orange bots float across the arena, exploding for major damage on contact.

Magitek Hexadrone  
- Circle of Death - Large AoE centered on the boss.
- 2-tonze Magitek Missile - Stack mechanic. 
- Chain Mine - A Hexadrone Bit appears and creates a damaging red field across the arena, restricting movement. Deals damage and knockback.
- Magitek Missiles - A tower appears; at least one player needs to stand in it to prevent group-wide damage.

Hypertuned Grynewaht
- Chainsaw - Boss charges up chainsaw and uses it in front, dealing continuous damage. Sidestep to avoid.
- Delay-action Charge - Two large AoEs track a pair of players. Move away from others. Later targets three at once. 
- Gunsaw - Targets and continually fires at one player. Pierces and hits anyone in line, so avoid moving it over party.
- Thermobaric Charge - Proximity marker tracks a player then drops. Marked player should move away before it goes off.
- Clean Cut - Magitek Chakrams slice across the arena from the edges. Watch where they appear to know where to dodge.
- Chain Mine - Same as Hexadrone except with Hypertuned Bits. Splits arena into quadrants, often used with Thermobaric Charge.

The dungeon also has additional treasure coffers that can contain gear or crafting materials. Completing it is associated with the "Mapping the Realm: Doma Castle" achievement.
