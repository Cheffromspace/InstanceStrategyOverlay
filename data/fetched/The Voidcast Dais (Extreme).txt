Here is the cleaned up text for the strategy guide on The Voidcast Dais (Extreme) trial in Final Fantasy 14:

The Voidcast Dais (Extreme) is a level 90 trial introduced in patch 6.4 with Endwalker.

Guide:

Assign light parties and Support / DPS pairs

Terrastorm - Slow falling Meteors on 2 diagonals with an AOE that touches in the middle. Move to a safe corner.

Lingering Spark - Drops a puddle on every player. Once the meteor AOE resolves, bait the cast by waiting until Lingering Spark's castbar completes, then run away. 

Phases of the Blade - Golbez cleaves the room in halves. First front, then behind. 

Binding Cold - Raidwide. Inflicts Frostbite for 8 seconds.

Gale Sphere - line aoes from front/back, then left/right order + Arctic Assault (shadowspread from Hades) on second hit

Void Meteor - Tank buster on both tanks, hits 5 times. 

Azdaja's Shadow - Phase change, although this transition is much faster than in normal mode as it not voiced and does not have an unskippable cutscene.

Black Fang - ultimate AoE

Azdaja's Shadow
- 3 hit tank line AoE busters + swap
- Phases of the Blade
- circling dragon with purple rings: donut + spread
- circling dragon with small ring & orbs: PB AoE + stacks

Double Meteor - MT flex for double ranged flares, H flex for double melee flares
- 2 people with flares: KB to open inters
- healer with KB: mid, baited line AoE
- towers at intercardinals: other people (3 stack in N, 2 stack in S)

Void Stardust
- trailing AoEs (exaflares): start on E/W side and move into the first exaflare that goes off (side to corner)

Enumeration (melee in, ranged at corners)

Eventide Fall - light parties OR Eventide Triad - role-based cleaves

Terrastorm
- with Arctic Assault (find safe quadrant) and healer stacks (melee in, ranged corner)

Lingering Spark - Puddles. Bait, then move. 

Pre-Enrage - Double stack of Binding Cold Frostbite then Void Meteor (5-hit double tankbuster)

Enrage - Golbez will cast Azdaja's Shadow in preperation and then slowly begin casting Black Fang. The boss must be defeated before this finishes or the party will wipe.
