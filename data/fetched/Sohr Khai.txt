Here is the cleaned up text for the Sohr Khai dungeon guide:

Sohr Khai is a level 60 dungeon introduced in patch 3.3 with Heavensward. With the addition of Duty Support in patch 6.3, changes to progression and bosses were implemented.

Duty Support:
- Aymeric (Lord Commander) - Tank or DPS 
- Alphinaud (Academician) - Healer or DPS
- Temple Banneret - DPS

Objectives:
1. Overcome Unsevered Despair
2. Overcome Unstifled Prayer 
3. Defeat Hraesvelgr

Bosses:

Chieftain Moglin
- Kill the adds that spawn. Knock them out of the circles to prevent them from resurrecting.
- AoE heal through Moglin's casts of Holy. 
- Otherwise, tank-and-spank.

Poqhiraj
- Stand in the center of the platform unless targeted, to prevent Quasar from hitting any walls.
- Place any Cloud Calls away from the party, near a wall that will or has been destroyed.
- Prefer standing by a wall during Charge. Prefer standing in the center of the corridor if no walls are left or you can't get to one in time.

Hraesvelgr
- Wyrmclaw: Tankbuster
- Hallowed Wings: Move to the opposite side of the glowing wing before the cast goes off.
- Holy Storm: Unavoidable party damage
- Hallowed Dive: Move to the middle after Hraesvelgr dives across to avoid the moving circle AoEs on the edges.
- Akh Morn: Multi-hit stack marker.
- Diamond Storm: Freezes the floor, causing players to slide in the direction they move. 
- Frigid Dive: Line AoE across middle while arena is frozen. Only slide if on top of a red AoE circle.
- Holy Breath: Spread out purple AoE circles.

Mechanics repeat until Hraesvelgr is defeated. Loot details are provided for each boss and additional treasure coffers.
