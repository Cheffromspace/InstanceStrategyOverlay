Here is the cleaned up text for the Pandæmonium: Anabaseios (Savage) strategy guide:

Pandæmonium: Anabaseios (Savage) is the 3rd section of Pandæmonium (Savage), the main 8-player raid in Endwalker. Released on May 30, 2023, one week after Anabaseios Normal, Anabaseios (Savage) requires players with item level of 630 or higher to enter.

Rewards
Upon completing Pandæmonium: Anabaseios (Savage) duties, one treasure coffer will appear containing Ascension Equipment Coffers and other rewards, which can be rolled on. Using this item transforms it into gear corresponding to the user's current job. Duplicate equipment coffers in a single treasure coffer will not appear. In addition to a weapon coffer, the coffer that appears upon completing Anabaseios: The Twelfth Circle (Savage) yields a random Ascension Weapon.

Weekly loot limits were removed in Patch 6.57.

Loot changes from previous tiers
- A maximum of one treasure coffer will spawn. Previous tiers contained a maximum of two coffers. Loot that would previously have been split into two coffers is now only found in one. 
- Duplicate gear coffers, which may previously have appeared in the first three duties, are no longer possible to appear.
- The chest gear (Ascension Chest Gear Coffer (IL 660)) coffer has been moved to become a drop from the third duty (Anabaseios: The Eleventh Circle (Savage)), when previously, the chest gear coffer would have dropped from the fourth duty. Note that this coffer does not drop from Anabaseios: The Twelfth Circle (Savage).

Item Exchange  
In addition to gear, players will receive an Anabaseios Mythos from each area, which can be exchanged for gear of your choosing. Instead of being rolled on, these automatically go to the player's inventory upon completing the duty.
