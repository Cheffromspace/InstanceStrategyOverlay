Here is the cleaned up text for the Omega: Alphascape strategy guide:

General Information
Omega: Alphascape is the 3rd section of Omega, the main 8-player raid in Stormblood. Released on September 18, 2018, Alphascape requires players with item level of 355 or higher to enter. Once unlocked, the raid can be queued from the Duty Finder.

Unlock
Players must first complete all of the Omega Quests up through Test World of Ruin. This includes clearing all of the Omega: Deltascape and Omega: Sigmascape raids.

Players can then begin the level 70 quest chain starting with In the Beginning, There Was Chaos by talking to Jessie in Rhalgr's Reach (X: 13.5, Y: 12.5).

To unlock each floor after the first, continue the quest line and complete the consecutive floor. Each floor is listed separately.
