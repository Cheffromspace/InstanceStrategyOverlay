Dialogue:
Y'shtola and the Warrior of Light visit the restricted archives in Noumenon to search for a forbidden tome from House Daemir detailing advanced methods for manipulating rift-spanning apertures. After locating the Epiphanies of House Daemir, they enlist the help of Nidhana, a Hannish alchemist, to assist in building a mock Atomos based on the Daemir research.

To prepare, Y'shtola asks the Warrior of Light to gather a flask of astrally-infused water from the Font of Maya while she petitions Vrtra to join them. Once the components are gathered, they plan to investigate the hidden voidgate sealed in the ruins at the bottom of the Bounty.
