The raid is also known asE8S.Contents1Phases & Abilities1.1Heritor of Frost: Shiva1.2Phase 11.2.1Mini-Phase #1 - Diamond Frost1.2.2Mini-Phase #2 - Light Rampant1.2.3Mini-Phase #3 - Shattered World1.3Phase 21.3.1Mini-Phase #4 - Icelit Dragonsong2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 23Achievements4ImagesPhases & AbilitiesHeritor of Frost:ShivaNOTE:It is possible to fall off the edge of the arena to an early doom during the entire encounter. However, should any participant fall, they can be raised after a moderate delay.Phase 1Absolute Zero- blasts the raid with a high amount of unavoidable damage, immediately followed byMirror, Mirror.Mirror, Mirrorsummons multiple portal-like mirrors at cardinal positions around the platform which will unleash an attack depending on the next ability Shiva uses.For future reference, keep in mind that summoned mirrors later in the battle will represent one of three different colours.Blue- reflect Shiva's next ability at the same time it is cast.Green- reflect Shiva's next ability after a short delay.Red- reflect Shiva's next ability after a moderate delay.The very first cast ofMirror, Mirrorwill always summon twoGreenmirrors and oneRedmirror. However, their placement will be random, except for one factor - there will never be mirrors to the south of the platform at this time. Before the mirrors unleash their mechanics, all players must first react to the ability being cast by Shiva, which will either be:Driving Frost- a vicious cone-attack against anyone directly behind Shiva.ORBiting Frost- a fatal cone-attack against anyone directly in front of Shiva.Unlike normal mode, neither of these mechanics will have an obvious telegraph, hence all players should learn which attack does what and move out of its way as soon as possible. Once Shiva's ability has been identified and players have reacted accordingly, the mirrors will use an ability based on which spell Shiva used.If Shiva usedDriving Frost(the backward AoE), each mirror will emit a cone-AoE across the platform, leaving safe spots directly in-between the mirror(s) themselves.If Shiva usedBiting Frost(the frontal AoE), each mirror will emit a large point-blank AoE across a majority of the platform. To avoid, players must move as far away from the mirror as possible (keeping in mind the order they are firing - Blue, then Green, then Red).Seeing as each individual colour fires at different speeds to the rest, players must ensure they stand between mirrors of the same colour (if more than one of each colour exists), then move to the safe spots created by the next colour(s). For example, if there are two green mirrors and two red mirrors, players should first stand between the two green mirrors, then move between the two red mirrors, seeing as green mirrors always fire before red mirrors.In summary, keep an eye on the colour of each mirror, then pay attention to the ability Shiva casts after portals have been summoned. Frontal AoE results in point-blank mirrors, and backward AoE results in cone-mirrors. Move away (or in-between) according to the order they are being fired (which is always Blue, then Green, then Red). With a little practice,Mirror, Mirrorwill become second nature.Mini-Phase #1 - Diamond FrostDiamond Frostcauses Shiva to teleport to the arena centre and bombard the raid with unavoidable raid-wide damage, followed by multiple mechanical follow-ups.Firstly, oneTankand oneHealerwill find themselves afflicted with aFreezingdebuff which, if not dispelled withEsuna, will result in those players being frozen solid. Healers must be ready to dispel these debuffs as soon as possible, as both victims will be subject to a follow-up flare (proximity) marker shortly after. If left to freeze solid, the result will typically be fatal for the raid.Secondly, the othertank, otherhealer, and twodamage dealerswill be targeted byFrigid Stone- AoE markers which will eventually inflict damage andheavy(slow). However, this version ofheavycannot be dispelled via Esuna and will persist for quite a while. After the AoE markers have detonated, star-like markers will be dropped at the locations of impact. After a brief delay, these markers explode, spewing straight-line AoE's in a star-like pattern.Thirdly, the outer edges of the arena will be marked by eight large white-circle AoE markers, indicating whereicicleswill begin to drop into the arena (in the order they were spawned). Anyone standing within a circle at the time icicles are dropped will immediately be slain, essentially forcing the entire raid to utilize the inner circle of the arena for the majority of mechanical overlaps. Bear in mind that onlysixof theeighticicles will drop initially, with two persisting until the mechanic overlap is nearly concluded. Watch out!While the mechanics are all close to resolving, Shiva will executeHeavenly Strike- a raid-wide knockback from the centre of the arena. Should anyone be standing near the outer edge of the arena at this time, they risk being punted off the platform to an early doom, or at risk of being slain by falling icicles.Lastly, the two damage dealers who were completely unmarked during the ordeal will be marked withFrigid Eruption, causing three AoE circles to spawn underneath them, one after another.To handle the overlapping mechanics, healers should first dispel the tank and healer affected byfreezingso that are free to position their upcoming flare markers. If not dispelled, they will be frozen in place instead and likely perish during the overlaps or wipe the raid via proximity (flare) markers. Simultaneously, the tank, healer and two damage-dealers effected byFrigid Stone(AoE markers) should position themselves close to Shiva (without overlapping AoE's onto other marked players) to her north-east, north-west, south-east and south-west. This gives marked players enough room to avoid standing in the way of upcomingicicles, provides room in the very centre of the arena (under Shiva) for unmarked players to stand in while waiting for theHeavenly Strikeknockback, and ensures that the resulting star-pattern markers are placed in a predictable pattern, making it easier for the entire raid to dodge the upcoming blasts.Shortly afterFrigid Stonedetonates, the star-markers will appear, giving everyone time to position themselves so that they will be knocked back where icicles have already been dropped (leaving behind safe areas). If the star-patterns were dropped correctly,Heavenly Strikewill also push players out of the path of the upcoming star-pattern explosions. However, the tank and healer originally marked withfreezingwill need to position themselves so that they are pushed away from the rest of the raid (and each-other) due to their flare (proximity) marker - and remember - two of the eight icicles will not have dropped yet, so do not get pushed into the remaining two icicle circles!AfterDiamond Frosthas concluded, all players should move to the centre of the arena, as Shiva will now execute eitherDriving FrostorBiting Frostdepending on which she cast during the firstMirror, Mirror. For example, if Shiva usedDriving Frostduring the firstMirror, Mirror, she will now useBiting Frostas soon as all the above mechanics have concluded - or vice versa.Double Slap- a vicious tank-buster against Shiva's primary target that also appliesPhysical Vulnerability. As a result, tanks should execute a tank-swap whilst Shiva is casting.Redress (Holy Form)- causes Shiva to change from one form to another. During her transformation, any player who looks directly at Shiva will be stunned for a prolonged period. Unlike normal mode, there will be no visual eye-icon to indicate this attack, thus players must rely on either listening to Shiva's voice-lines or keeping an eye out for a very noticeable glowing effect around Shiva before she switches forms. Once you see the glowing effect or her hear usual transformation voice-line, all players should look away until she has changed into her new form. As soon as she has transformed into her new form, she will execute eitherScythe KickorAxe Kick.(Holy Form) Axe Kick- a massive point blank AoE circle directly underneath Shiva that will cover 90% of the circular arena. Move away as quickly as possible to avoid damage and debuffs.OR(Holy Form) Scythe Kick- a massive donut AoE from Shiva's hitbox. Players must move into her hitbox to avoid damage and debuffs.NOTE:Unlike Normal mode, neither kick will display the usual orange-circular telegraphs. Instead, players must pay attention to which kick Shiva is executing and either move within her hitbox (Scythe) or move away from her (Axe) as soon as possible. There will be no other telegraphs to make it more obvious, so watch out!Mini-Phase #2 - Light RampantLight Rampant- causes Shiva to teleport to the arena centre and bombard the raid with unavoidable raid-wide damage, followed by multiple mechanical follow-ups.Firstly, all players will become afflicted with 0-2 stacks ofLightsteeped- a stackable debuff that will detonate any individual(s) that reach 5 stacks, unleashing massive raid-wide damage that will potentially slay the raid outright. Further stacks ofLightsteepedwill be acquired by anyone who takes damage from mechanics during this mini-phase. As a result, all players must handle upcoming mechanics without anyone reaching 5 stacks.Secondly,Refulgent Chainswill tether one tank, one healer, and two damage dealers together. To complicate matters, one set of chains will detonate if the tethered players move too far away from each other, while another set of chains will detonate if the tethered pair moves too close to each other. The goal is to resolve upcoming mechanics whilst all four chained players remain as close/far from each other as needed. Eventually, Shiva (who is rooted in the centre of the arena during this mini-phase) will also castPath of Light, causing her to shoot cone-AoE's at all four chained players.Thirdly, fourMeteor Towerswill spawn around Shiva's hit-box - each containing orbs of light that begin to descend down toward the platform. Each tower will require one player to stand inside a circle to soak these falling orbs. Once the first four towers have been soaked, two more towers will spawn at the north or south (each requiring 2 players to soak them) - and once those two towers have been soaked, one final tower will spawn underneath Shiva herself that requirs 4 players to soak. If any meteor tower does not contain the required number of soakers by the time that meteor collides with the platform, the raid will be wiped.Remember - soaking a tower will add a stack ofLightsteeped!.Lastly, fourBright Orbswill tether themselves to the unchained tank, healer, and damage-dealers. After a brief delay, each orb will begin to travel towards the player it is tethered to. Initially, all orbs are large in size, yet they will visiblyshrinkover time. If aBright Orbcollides withANYplayer (tethered or not), the orb will explode, dealing damage to that player relative to the size of the orb. In summary, players tethered toBright Orbsmust kite them around the room (away from other players) until they visibly decrease in size (twice). At that point, colliding with the orb will inflict minimal damage.However, colliding with an orb will inflict a stack ofLightsteeped. As a result, orbs need to be popped by people who have less than 4 stacks, regardless of whether they are tethered to it or not.There is a lot going on during this mini-phase, though there are also plenty of methods you can use to overcome them. Just remember - taking damage from mechanics during this mini-phase will apply a stack ofLightsteeped, and reaching 5 stacks will detonate you, inflicting tremendous damage to the raid. Keep this in mind when soaking meteor-towers or colliding with orbs, as doing so will apply a stack to all soakers or colliders. If you have 4 stacks, it is imperative that you avoid further mechanics.In general, all players withRefulgent Chainsshould be soakingMeteor Towers(seeing as chained players willNOTbe tethered toBright Orbsand have no need to kite around the room). Meanwhile, players tethered toBright Orbswill be free to kite them around the outer edge of the arena in a circle (in the same direction) away from all other players until they visibly shrink in size (twice). However, players kiting orbs must also be mindful ofPath of Light, which causes Shiva to fire cone-AoE's towards chained players.Assuming all mechanics are resolved and the raid survives, the fight resumes.Mirror, Mirror- causes Shiva to summon fourGreen Mirrorsat all inter-cardinal (or cardinal) positions around the arena. As explained before, these mirrors will unleash an ability depending on what spell Shiva executes after the mirrors have been summoned. From here, Shiva will cast eitherAxe KickorScythe Kick- whichever of the two kicks she 'didn't' use before theLight Rampantmini-phase.If Shiva casts(Holy Form) Axe Kick(an un-telegraphed point blank AoE directly underneath Shiva), all players will need to run away from Shiva to avoid the AoE, then immediately rush back to the centre to avoid point-blank AoE's from all mirrors. Whilst moving back to Shiva to avoid the mirror attacks, Shiva will also castBanish, marking all damage-dealers with stack-up markers. However, these stack-up markers can either be real or fake. If Shiva has one orb circling above her head whilst castingBanish, the stack-up markers are real. As a result, all four marked players will need to stack with one un-marked player each. Once the mirrors have unleashed their AoE, pairs can spread out to avoid overlapping with other marked players. If Shiva has four orbs above her head whilst castingBanish, the stack-up markers are fake, meaningALLplayers must avoid each other entirely.ORIf Shiva casts(Holy Form) Scythe Kick(an un-telegraphed donut AoE from Shiva's hitbox), all players must avoid the attack by standing beneath Shiva, then move to towards a mirror - all of which will unleash a donut AoE of their own after a brief delay. However, Shiva will also castBanishshortly after executing her ownScythe Kick, marking damage dealers withrealorfakestack-up markers depending on whether Shiva has one orb above her head (real) or four orbs (fake) during theBanishcast. If the stack-up markers arereal(one orb), then each marked player will need to stand underneath a mirror of their own along with a partner in order to soak the damage (without overlapping other marked players). If the stack-up markers arefake(four orbs), then all players must spread out as soon as mirrors have executed their donut-AoE's.Seeing as the stack-up markers fromBanishwillONLYaffect damage-dealers, it is wise to pair each damage-dealer with one tank or healer before the battle (as well as a direction to move to). By doing so, the raid will be ready to move to a designate mirror and have an assigned partner on stand-by in-caseBanishmarkers are real.Mini-Phase #3 - Shattered WorldShiva will leap towards the northern edge of the arena and castShattered World, causing two circles to appear within the arena. Unlike normal mode (which divides the raid automatically), players will need to manually divide themselves into two groups - one group per circle. After a brief delay, Shiva leaps to the centre of the arena and shatters the platform, transitioning into an add-phase. Players within each circle will now be teleported to different platforms and will be unable to interact with each-other for the duration of the add phase. Any player not standing within a circle during theShattered Worldcast will immediately be slain.Once the transitional animation has completed, both groups will find themselves on their own individual platform, each with a large crystal in the centre, as well as a noticeableFlood Of Lightgauge. Much like normal mode, the central crystal will periodically bombard the group with high volumes of unavoidable damage. At the same time, each group will be tasked with slaying waves adds that spawn at the outer edges of the platform and begin travelling towards the central crystal. If any add hits the central crystal, points will be added to theFlood of Lightgauge. If the gauge reaches max, the raid will be wiped. However, if the raid successfully beats the add phase without any points being added to theFlood of Lightgauge, the raid will be granted adamage-upbuff!Both platforms will need to deal with four waves of adds before the phase ends.Unlike normal mode, each add now has their own unique effects.Earthen Aether- will attempt to castStoneskinas soon as it spawns. If successful, the earthen add will become significantly harder to kill. As a result, players should interruptStoneskinas soon as an earthen add is spawned.Lightning Aether- reflects damage back towards their attackers. Due to the frequent crystal AoE, players must be careful not to nuke themselves or overburden their healers via reflected damage.Aqueous Aether- stunnable (and slowable) water adds with far more health than all the other adds. Due to being much beefier, players will need to stall the water add via stuns and slows for as long as possible whilst burning through its increased health-pool.Crystalline Snowflake- an untargetable add that tethers itself to the central crystal and prepares to shoot light towards it. If the add remains tethered to the crystal, points will be added to theFlood Of Lightgauge. To prevent this, one player must intercept the tether and take the hit instead. However, taking damage from this add will inflictLight Resistance Down. As a result, any player who intercepts a tether must avoid doing so again as they will take tremendous damage thanks to the debuff (unless they can utilize an immunity cooldown).It is worth noting that each platform comes with its own pattern of adds to deal with. The only constant is that both platforms will always involve fourtethers(one per wave), for a total of four tethers each. As a result, it is wise for each group to assign an intercept order due to theLight Resistance Downdebuff inflicted upon tethered players.Assuming both groups successfully defeat all four waves of adds without letting theFlood of Lightgauge reach maximum, the battle will transition to the final phase.Phase 2After a transitional animation, showing Shiva merging with Hraesvelgr into a new form that is unique to savage mode, the final phase begins.Shiva will continuously auto-attack the top two players in the enmity list during the entirety of phase 2 for considerable damage. Due to this fact, both the main and off-tank must ensure that they have more enmity (aggro) than everyone else in the group at all possible times. Just to be safe, all players should give both tanks the opportunity to generate enmity before nuking the boss. If someone other than a tank reaches number 1-2 on the enmity list, they risk taking tremendous (likely fatal) damage.Akh Morn- causes Shiva to blast the top two players in the enmity list with a vicious triple-blast of shareable magic damage that will also apply a green or blue debuff to those hit by the blasts. For example, if both tanks are number 1 and 2 on the enmity list, one tank will be blasted with shareable damage that applies agreendebuff, while the other tank will be blasted with shareable damage that applies abluedebuff. While these debuffs persist, any player being blasted by an opposite colour will immediately be slain. As a result of this mechanic, the raid must split into two groups and have each group stack with a tank (away from the other group), giving one half of the raid thegreendebuff and the other half thebluedebuff. From this point onward, all casts ofAkh Mornmust be shared by the same groups/debuffs.Morn Afah- causes Shiva to blast her primary target with a vicious blast of shareable damage.Morn Afahcan either be shared by the entire raid to prevent fatal damage, or soaked by a lone tank via aninvulnerability cooldown, such asHallowed GroundorSuperbolide.Mirror, Mirror- causes Shiva to summon aRed Mirrorin the east or west of the arena, aBlue Mirrorin the remaining east or west spot, and aGreen Mirrorto the north of the arena.As explained earlier, all mirrors will reflect/mimic Shiva's next ability and each reflected ability will be delayed depending on the colour of the mirror. As described earlier,Blue Mirrorswill reflect Shiva's next abilityas soon as it is cast,Green Mirrorswill reflect Shiva's abilityshortlyafterit has been cast, andRed Mirrorswill reflect Shiva's next abilityafter a much longer delay. In short,BluebeforeGreenbeforeRed.The inclusion ofBlue Mirrorsin this phase means that all players must react to Shiva's next ability AND theBlue Mirrorability at the same time, then position themselves to deal with theGreen Mirror, and finally, theRed Mirror.Hallowed Wing- causes Shiva to leap to the centre of the arena and stretch out her wings, with one of the two wings gaining a very noticeable effect. AfterHallowed Winghas been fully cast, Shiva will blast tremendous AoE damage in the direction of the glowing wing, covering 50% of the arena. For example - if Shiva's left wing is glowing whileHallowed Wingis being cast, all players must move to the right side of the arena to avoid being blasted. To complicate matters further, theBlue Mirrorwill reflect this ability at the same time it is cast (and in the same direction). So, if Shiva's left-wing is glowing whileHallowed Wing, she will blast 50% of the arena to her left, and theBlue Mirrorwill blast 50% of the arena to its left as well, leaving only a quarter of the arena as asafe spot.Players must quickly identify the safe side of Shiva and also the direction that theBlue Mirrorwill fire, then immediately move into the safe quadrant. Once theBlue Mirrorhas fired, theGreen Mirrorwill reflectHallowed Wingin the same direction (relative to where it is facing), and lastly, theRed Mirrorwill do the same.NOTE: If you notice theRed Mirrorto the west (orBlue Mirrorto the east), then the reflected abilities will force the raid to move in a counter-clockwise motion. Vice-versa also applies. If you notice theBlue Mirrorto the west (orRed Mirrorto the east), players will need to move in a clockwise motion.Wyrm's Lament- inflicts unavoidable raid-wide damage and brands all tanks and healers with a(Red) Wrymclawdebuff, and all damage-dealers with a(Blue) Wyrmclawdebuff. Debuffs of both colours will have set durations per player, ranging from 13s-38s (Red) and 20s-44s (Blue). Simultaneously, an etherealDragon Headwill spawn at the north of the arena and begin to rotate around the platform in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation. ThisDragon Headmust be used by players to cleanse their debuffs.If a debuff naturally expires (without being cleansed), that player will immediately be slain, and because every player will have a different duration, players with the lowest durations will need to cleanse themselves before those of higher durations.Players with(Red) Wrymclawcan cleanse their debuff by touching theDragon Head, which will inflict moderate damage on contact and cause that player to drop a small glowing puddle at their current location.Players with(Blue) Wrymclawcan cleanse their debuff by touching one of the above-mentioned glowing puddles.To complicate the process further, Shiva will periodically castHallowed Wingtowards the side of the arena that the dragon is travelling, forcing the raid to cleanse themselves based on their debuff durations whilst avoiding fatal AoE blasts.To combat the overlapped mechanics, players must quickly identify who has the shorted (Red) duration and have them immediately cleanse themselves as soon as theDragon Headhas spawned, then immediately move back to the centre to avoid upcomingHallowed Wingblasts. Shortly afterwards, Shiva will blast 50% of the platform withHallowed Wing(in the direction theDragon Headis travelling), making cleansing unsafe. OnceHallowed Winghas resolved, the (Blue) player with the lowest duration must run into the glowing puddle to cleanse their own debuff, whilst the player with the lowest (Red) timer quickly touches theDragon Headto cleanse themself before the nextHallowed Wingcast, and so on.Once all debuffs have been resolved, Shiva willRedress. Before this happens, all players should make sure they are positioned in the centre of the arena very close to Shiva. If anyone died due to not cleansing the debuff, the party will wipe toJoyless Dragonsongas she does so.Redress (Ice Form)- causes Shiva to transform into her original form and blanket the entire arena in thin ice. During this time, any player who moves will begin sliding uncontrollably in the direction they move. To combat the next wave of mechanics, the entire raid should have positioned themselves in the arena centre close to Shiva. However, this means that moving duringThin Icewill likely result in players slipping over the edge of the platform seeing as sliding distance is exceptionally long. Shortly after, Shiva will begin to cast one of two abilities at random. However,Thin Icewill resolve halfway through the cast of this ability. Due to this fact, players mustavoid movinguntil the ice has disappeared, then immediately react to the upcoming ability as it will leave a very short window to react.Twin Stillness- causes Shiva to aim a 270-degree cone attack directly in front of her for fatal damage, followed by a 90-degree cone attack directly behind her. OnceThin Icehas resolved, players will have a very short opportunity to move directly behind Shiva to avoid the frontal attack, then move in front of her to avoid the backward cone.ORTwin Silence- is an inverse version, causing Shiva to unleash the 90-degree backward cone first, then slash in-front of her with the 270-degree cone. OnceThin Icehas resolved, players must move directly in front of Shiva to avoid the backward cone, then behind her to avoid the massive frontal attack.Double Slap- Shiva executes a vicious tank-buster against her primary target, applyingPhysical Vulnerability, requiring an immediate tank-swap whilst Shiva is casting.Redress (Hraesvelgr)- causes Shiva toRedressinto her Hraesvelgr form and immediately begin castingAkh Ral. Once the cast is complete, multi-hitting AoE blasts will form at the location(s) where all players were standing at the time. Once the cast has completed, all players must immediately move away from where they were standing to avoid being blasted to death. To make the mechanic easier, the raid should split into two groups and stack together in order to bait the blasts into two locations (such as the east and west sides of Shiva's hitbox) and then immediately move to the north and south onceAkh Ralhas been cast.Mirror, Mirror- causes Shiva to summon aGreen MirrorandRed Mirrorto the east and west of the platform in a random pattern. Once both mirrors are summoned, Shiva will leap to the northern or southern edge of the arena and begin channellingHallowed Wings. Unlike previous versions ofHallowed Wings, both of Shiva's wings will glow this time, indicating that theleft & rightside of the arena will be blasted simultaneously. To avoid, players must position themselves directlybehindShiva as soon as possible.OnceHallowed Wingshas concluded, all participants should move directly in front of theGreen Mirror, which will blast the raid with unavoidable damage, inflictMagic Vulnerabilityon thefour closest playersto the mirror, and knock-back the entire group a set distance across the platform. After a moderate delay, theRed Mirrorwill do the exact same thing. Players will have a brief opportunity to heal up from theGreen Mirrorblast and have the four players who are unaffected by theMagic Vulnerability Debuffstand close to theRed Mirror, as being blasted with a stack ofMagic Vulnerabilityfrom theGreen Mirrorwill likely be fatal.Mirror, Mirror- summons twoBlue Mirrorsto the east and west, twoRed Mirrorsto the north and south, and fourGreen Mirrorsin each inter-cardinal position (corners).Redress (Holy Form)- causes Shiva to change clothes, forcing the raid to look away to avoid being stunned. At this point, all mirrors will also reflect the gaze attack. As explained before,Blue Mirrorsreflect at the same time Shiva casts an ability, whereasGreen Mirrorsreflect after a short delay, andRed Mirrorsreflect after a much longer delay.The goal is to look away from Shiva (and theBlue Mirrors) at the same time, then avoid looking atGreen Mirrors, and finally, avoid looking atRed Mirrors(in that order). This can easily be achieved by pulling Shiva directly in front of aBlue Mirrorbefore she redresses and have the entire group look to the left or right when the gaze attack is about to go off. Once concluded, theBlue Mirrorswill despawn. Players can then run through Shiva and turn to look in the direction of where their chosenBlue Mirrorwas previously located, which will cause everyone to avoid the gaze attack from theGreen Mirrors.NOTE: Before theRed Mirrorsreflect their gaze attack, Shiva will castHoly- spawning a proximity marker in the centre of the arena. To make matters worse, this proximity marker will either berealorfakedepending on the amount of orbs hovering over Shiva's head whileHolywas being cast. If Shiva hasone orbcircling her head while casting, the ability isreal, forcing the raid to position themselves at the outer edge of the arena to avoid the central proximity marker (whilst also looking away fromRed Mirrors). If Shiva hasfour orbscircling her head while castingHoly, the central proximity marker is afake, so instead of moving to the outer-edges, players will need to position themselves in the centre of the arena to avoid cardinal and inter-cardinal markers around the outer-edges (and also look away fromRed Mirrors).As a rule of thumb - one orb equals one proximity marker (centre) and multiple orbs means multiple proximity markers (edges).No matter whether they are real or fake, proximity markers will detonate at the exact same time asRed Mirrorgaze attacks, which will stun any player looking in the direction of a mirror.OnceMirror, MirrorandHolyhave concluded, Shiva will cast one of two abilities:Embittered Dance- causes Shiva to unleash aScythe Kick(un-telegraphed donut AoE at her current location), followed by anAxe Kick(an un-telegraphed point blank AoE directly underneath Shiva). In this case, players will need to move into her hitbox (or stand at max range) to avoid the donut attack, then run away from her to avoid the point-blank circle AoE.ORSpiteful Dance- a reverse of the above. Shiva will first use herAxe Kick(un-telegraphed point blank AoE directly underneath herself), followed by theScythe Kick(donut AoE from her hitbox). Players will need to move as far away from Shiva as possible at first, then move into her hit-box (or remain at max-range) to avoid the follow-up donut AoE.Mirror, Mirror- summons a singleRed Mirrorto the north of the arena, followed byRedress (Hraesvelgr).Akh Ralwill start casting as soon as Shiva have transformed. Just like earlier, the raid should split into two groups and stack together in order to bait the blasts into two specific locations and then immediately move out of those locations onceAkh Ralhas been cast. However, theRed Mirrorwill reflectAkh Ral, forcing the raid to move once again to avoid another bout of blasts yet again. Simply split into two groups like before and bait Shiva's initialAkh Ralattacks to her north and south (or east and west if you prefer), and then have both groups rotate in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction to avoid it, and then rotate once again to avoid the reflected version from theRed Mirror.Akh Morn- causes Shiva to blast one tank with shareable damage that applies agreendebuff, while the other tank will be blasted with shareable damage that applies abluedebuff. The raid must split into two groups once again and have each group stack with a tank (away from the other group), giving one half of the raid thegreendebuff and the other half thebluedebuff. Whilst the debuffs persist, all casts ofAkh Mornmust be shared by the same groups/colours.Morn Afah- blasts her primary target with shareable damage. Once again,Morn Afahcan either be shared by the entire raid to prevent fatal damage, or soaked by a lone tank via aninvulnerability cooldown.Mini-Phase #4 - Icelit DragonsongShiva teleports to the centre of the arena and bombards the raid with a massive wave of overlapping mechanics.Similar to theLight Rampantmini-phase earlier in the fight, players will have to contend withLightsteepeddebuffs (which will instantly slay anyone who acquires 5 stacks),Refulgent Chains(which will explode, killing any chained players who move too close or too far away from their partners), three waves ofMeteor Towers(which will require a certain amount of players to stand within each tower to avoid meteor wipes),Frigid StoneAoE markers that will eventually drop exploding star-like markers at all victims locations,Freezingdebuffs which can completely freeze people in place if not dispelled, andHeavenly Strikeknockback from the centre of the arena..Remember - being hit by certain mechanics during this mini-phase will apply a stack ofLightsteeped, thus they must all be resolved without any player acquiring 5 stacks, or the raid will very likely suffer a wipe.Firstly,Freezingwill be applied to 2 tanks and 2 damage-dealers. These can be dispelled viaEsuna, but should be left on both tanks.Secondly, four waves ofMeteor Towerswill spawn during the mini-phase. Don't forget that players soaking these towers will acquire a stack ofLightsteeped!Thirdly,Refulgent Chainswill connect all tanks and healers together, forcing them to remain at a set distance from one another to avoid detonation. As a result ofRefulgent Chains, all tanks and healers will need to soak the first two waves ofMeteor Towers- one player per tower.Fourthly, all four damage-dealers will be afflicted with an AoE circle marker (Frigid Stone') that will eventually detonate for moderate damage andheavydebuffs, leaving behind a star-patterned AoE markers at their location, which will explode later, eventually spewing straight-line AoE's in 4x star-patterns across the arena that all players must avoid.Fifthly, Shiva will also castHeavenly Strike- a raid-wide knockback from the centre of the arena that all players must use to avoid the star-pattern explosions, followed by even moreMeteor Towers.Sixthly, damage dealers will also have to contend withFrigid Eruption, causing three AoE circles to spawn underneath them, one after another.Seventhly, Shiva will eventually castBanishat a random tank, which will either berealorfakedepending on how many orbs are circling her head while it is being cast. Just like before, a single orb over her head meansreal, whereas four orbs over her head indicatesfake.(Real) Banishresults in a single stack-marker on the chosen tank, whereas(Fake) Banishcauses stack-up markers on both tanks at once.Lastly, the entire phase concludes with Shiva unleashingThe House Of Light, causing her to aim conal attacks in the direction of ALL players, inflicting stacks ofLightsteepedto everyone caught in the blast. Due to overlap being unavoidable, all players must resolve this complex phase with every players having no more than 3 stacks ofLightsteeped, or the raid will wipe.In summary, healers should immediately dispelFreezingfrom any non-tanks who have acquired it. Meanwhile, the tanks and healers (who will be chained together for the duration of the phase) should each move into the single-soakMeteor Towers, preferably with healers taking east and west towers, while tanks take the north and south towers. Simultaneously, all damage-dealers affected byFrigid Stoneshould move to the outer-edge of the arena, dropping their star-like markers at inter-cardinal positions (NE,NW,SE,SW). OnceFrigid Stonedetonates, all damage-dealers will beheavy, thus they must rush to the centre as soon as possible via sprint or gap-closers to avoid being knocked over the edge by the upcomingHeavenly Strikeknockback, which Shiva will currently be casting.Just beforeHeavenly Strikedetonates, both tanks will be frozen solid due to the undispelledFreezingdebuffs, rendering them immune to the knockback and rooting them in place. At the same time, twoMeteor Towerswill spawn at the outer-edge of the arena to the east and west, and the star-pattern explosions dropped byFrigid Stonewill become telegraphed. If done correctly, both healers will be knocked into the east and westMeteor Towers(which will be safe from the star-explosions), both tanks will be frozen in a safe-spot from the star-explosions, and damage-dealers will be free to move to the north and south side of Shiva to be knocked into safe-spots. If damage-dealers get knocked intoMeteor Towers(by standing to the east or west), they will acquire additional stacks ofLightsteepedand likely wipe the raid. If they remain in diagonal positions duringHeavenly Strike, they will be knocked into star-pattern AoE's and likely perish.As soon as the star-markers explode,Frigid Eruptionwill begin dropping three consecutive AoE circles underneath each damage dealer one after another, forcing them to rotate around the outer edge of the arena in a clockwise or counter-clockwise pattern to avoid overlapping other damage-dealers. Simultaneously, Shiva will begin to castBanishon a random tank, which may berealorfake(depending on how many orbs are circling her head during the cast). At the same time, one finalMeteor Towerwill spawn within Shiva's hitbox.(Real) Banishresults in a single stack-marker on the chosen tank, whereas(Fake) Banishcauses stack-up markers on both tanks at once. While determining ifBanishis real or fake, both tanks should move into the finalMeteor Towerto prepare. IfBanishis real, both tanks can soak the single stack-marker together and simultaneously satisfy the two-person tower requirement. IfBanishis fake, both tanks will need to spread apart as soon as the two-person tower has been soaked.If done correctly, four players will have 3 stacks ofLightsteeped, while the remaining four players only have 2 stacks. If so, all four players with 2 stacks ofLightsteepedmust stand in the final 4-personMeteor Towerso that the entire raid ends up with 3 stacks ofLightsteepedeach.Finally, Shiva will begin to castThe House Of Light, which will eventually shoot a cone attack towards every single player in the group simultaneously. Once the final 4-personMeteor Towerhas been soaked, all players must spread out around Shiva at cardinal and inter-cardinal positions so that only one person is hit per cone attack, resulting in the entire raid having exactly 4 stacks ofLighsteeped, which will eventually drop off. If any player for any reason acquires 5 stacks ofLightsteeped, the results will likely be fatal.Mirror, Mirror- summons a singleRed Mirrorto the north of the arena, followed byRedress (Ice Form), blanketing the entire platform inThin Ice. It is wise to pull Shiva to the north of the platform beforeThin Icelands. Once done, Shiva will begin toRedress (Hraesvelgr). As soon Shiva has sprouted her draconic wings, players should immediately slide to the south (behind Shiva) to avoidAkh Ral, which will AoE blast the locations that all players where standing in just before the slide.Wyrm's Lament- inflicts unavoidable raid-wide damage and then brands two tanks and two damage dealers with the(Red) Wrymclawdebuff, whereas the two remaining damage-dealers (and both healers) will acquire the(Blue) Wyrmclawdebuff. This time, TWO etherealDragon Headswill spawn - one to the north and one to the south - which will both rotate in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion for the duration of the mechanic. Similar to before,Dragon Headswill be used by players to cleanse their (Red) debuffs, whilst the pools of light left behind by cleansed (Red) debuffs will be used to cleanse (Blue) debuffs. However, players will be able to cleanse themselves two at a time during this mini-phase.Remember: If a debuff naturally expires (without being cleansed), that player will immediately be slain!To complicate the cleansing process, Shiva will periodically bombard both tanks withAkh Morn- 5x consecutive blasts of shareable damage that also appliesblueandgreendebuffs to those who share them. Much like every previousAkh Morn, any player sharing damage of the opposite colour once these debuffs have been assigned will be slain outright, thus the group must split in half and only soak damage with that same group - one group per tank-soak.As soon as the firstAkh Mornhas concluded, Shiva will begin castingMorn Afah, the shareable tank-buster that can either be soaked by the whole raid (regardless of debuff/colour), or avoided using anInvulnerability Cooldown, which will make it infinitely easier for tanks to cleanse their debuffs. Once two (Red) debuffs have been cleansed by touching theDragon Heads, two (Blue) players can remove their debuffs using thepuddlesthat were left behind. Shortly afterward,Akh Mornwill be cast once again, except it will now hit 6x times in succession, followed by anotherMorn Afah. If successfully soaked, two more players can cleanse their (Red) debuff, allowing two more (Blue) players to cleanse theirs via the puddles.Akh Mornwill be cast once more for x7 consecutive blasts, followed by anotherMorn Afahand another opportunity for 2x (Red) and 2x (Blue) cleanses.Having survived this healing-intensive onslaught, Shiva will summonRed Mirrorsaround the entire arena, then face north or south while castingHallowed Wings(with both wings glowing). The entire raid must move behind Shiva to avoid this fatal attack. Now, allRed Mirrorswill long-cast their reflection ofHallowed Wings, which will result in an unavoidable raid-wipe if Shiva is not defeated beforehand.LootSee also:Edenchoir Weapons1Book of Refulgence(Guaranteed)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityPaladin's Edenchoir Arms (IL 505)OtherN/ACBlue1Edenchoir BattleaxeMarauder's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir GreatswordDark Knight's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir GunbladeGunbreaker's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir ForkLancer's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir JamadharsPugilist's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir Samurai BladeSamurai's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir DaggersRogue's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir Harp BowArcher's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir ArquebusMachinist's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir ChakramsDancer's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir RodTwo-handed Thaumaturge's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir IndexArcanist's Grimoire505CBlue1Edenchoir RapierRed Mage's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir CaneTwo-handed Conjurer's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir CodexScholar's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir TorquetumAstrologian's Arm505CBlue1Edenchoir Chest Gear Coffer (IL 500)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityEdenchoir Weapon Coffer (IL 505)OtherN/AABasic1Wind-up RyneMinionN/AABasic1Ramuh CrystalOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchSavage Trouble in Paradise I5CompleteEden's Verse (Savage).-5.21Savage Trouble in Paradise II10CompleteEden's Verse (Savage)5 times.-5.2Savage Trouble in Paradise III20CompleteEden's Verse (Savage)10 times.-5.2Mightier than the Verse5Complete Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage) with a party of only blue mages, Silence Echo turned on, and Unrestricted Party turned off.-6.45ImagesRaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
