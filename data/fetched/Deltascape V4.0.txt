The effect of these spells will change based on whether or not he is channeling energy from the large void orb outside of the arena. When he does, he will visibly face the orb and will tether to it, at which point players should watch out for the more dangerous variations of the spells since there will be no other indication of the different effect.AbilityNormalVoidBlizzardWill place AOE's under some players feet that detonate at the end of the cast.At 75% of the cast bar start moving, and keep moving until you see yourself take damage.

Stack behind the boss to share damageThe Decisive Battle:This will be cast at 66% and 33% health. He will disappear and a meteor marker will appear in the center of the arena. Run to the edge of the arena to reduce proximity damage. Once the meteor hits a giant head will appear in the center. Directly on the head is an AOE that inflicts Heavy and a DOT, so avoid running through the head. Players should run behind it to avoid getting hit by a conal AOE the head will cast after a short time. Getting hit will inflict Zombification, making you uncontrollably chase other players to attack them. After the first time this is cast the boss will now also begin castingFlareandBlack Holes.The boss will cast Decisive Battle again at33%, and will also spawn vines in a ring that will attack facing the edge of the arena, forcing players closer to the proximity marker. There will be a missing vine leaving a safe spot to distance yourself from the main aoe, after which the head will appear like last time.Black Holes:After the first Decisive Battle Exdeath will now cast black holes. These will appear around the arena and cause damage if you stand in them, so avoid standing in them.Flare:3 players will get marked with spread markers (3 white, outwards-pointing arrows). Marked players should distance themselves from the main party as well as each other to prevent proximity damage.Loot1Deltascape CrystalloidTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDeltascape ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape CrankOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape SpringOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDeltascape ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape SpringOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape PedalOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 3NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityWind-up ExdeathMinionN/AABasic1Decisions (Omega) Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1DialogueExdeath: Hahaha...
