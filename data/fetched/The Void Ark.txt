When all of the Hybodus are dead, Cetus will become targetable and useBody Slam.Hydrobomb: While the Hybodus are still alive, Cetus will mark a random player with a green crosshair and begin slowly chasing them, dropping circle AoEs behind itself as it travels.

Do not stand on the buttons when there is static or you will die.IrminsulandSawtoothLife Tether: Irminsul and Sawtooth are permanently tethered to each other. When the HP difference between the two grows too large, Sawtooth will drain health from or transfer health to Irminsul, equalizing their HP totals.Resistances: As the battle starts, both Irminsul and Sawtooth will each gain one of eitherRanged ResistanceorMagic Resistancebuffs, rendering that boss invincible to attack from Physical Ranged DPS jobs, or Caster and Healer jobs, respectively. Which boss receives each resistance is random.White Breath: A wide cone from Sawtooth's front, dealing moderate damage.Mucus Bomb: Three random players are marked with large green-yellow circle AoEs. After a short delay, balls of mucus splatter over the targeted players and anyone inside the AoEs, dealing minor damage, tethering affected players to up to two other affected players, and inflicting them withSeizedfor 20 seconds, rendering them unable to move or perform actions. Players who are not seized can walk through the mucus tethers to break them, and once a player is no longer tethered to anyone else, the Seized debuff is dispelled.Mucus Spray: A small untelegraphed ring attack around Sawtooth with the same effects as Mucus Bomb.Shockwave Stomp: Irminsul becomes shielded andInvincibleto all damage, while Sawtooth slowly charges the attack. At the end of the cast, Sawtooth slams the ground, dealing 30,000 damage to all players not hiding behind Irminsul.Sawtooth Feeds: Several very weakArk Kedadds will appear. After a few moments, Sawtooth will bury its heads into the ground and cause large circular rumbling dirt AoEs to appear below the Keds (or random players if the Keds are dead). Any players hit areDevoured, removing them from the fight temporarily. A few moments later, the devoured players are regurgitated with aParasiteplant attached to their head for 15 seconds, and are forced to walk toward allies andattackthem with short range cone AoEs. Other players hit by these attacks are in turn also infested with aParasite.Pulse of the Void: A circle AoE centered on Irminsul that it uses periodically.

Deals moderate damage and inflicts a curableConcussiondamage over time debuff.Idol of Impurity: FourGyrtoweradds appear in the arena. The towers each inflict an additional stack ofBleedinguntil they are destroyed.Void Pact: Void portals will appear over the raised platforms in the arena, eventually spawningFoobaradds.

Any player or Foobar in the cone is pulled directly in front of Cuchulainn.Devour: Used immediately afterBeckonif there are any Foobars in melee range. Cuchulainn devours the Foobar add, instantly killing it and boosting his next attack.Bile Below: Arena-wide instant-kill attack immediately after the second wave of Foobars. To avoid it, stand on the raised platforms.Pestilence: Cuchulainn sprays vomit all over the arena, dealing damage, which can be lessened by standing on the raised platforms. If Cuchulainn had eaten at least one Foobars, this attack deals extremely high damage, almost guaranteeing that players not standing on the platforms will die.Black Lung: All players are given another stack of the indefiniteBleedingdebuff, and eightBlack Phlegmorbs will appear around the arena. These orbs must be touched to "defuse" them, dealing moderate damage to players near them, destroying the orbs in the process.
