Once known for his kindness to both warders and captives alike, he now appears before you as an amalgamation of mythic beast and man─a hemitheos. Drunk with devotion to Lahabrea and dripping venom for Erichthonios, Asphodelos's keeper may too be its most fearsome creation...— In-game descriptionAsphodelos: The Fourth Circleis a level 90raidintroduced inpatch 6.01withEndwalker.

After a short time the curtain glows red, then disappears, revealing one of four elemental quadrants he uses for his next attack.  Setting the Stage itself deals no damage.Pinax- One of the four elemental wells flares with power. Then an attack lands depending on what well discharged. Touching one of the wells will also inflict a status effect:Electrocutionfor lightning,Dropsyfor water,Pollenfor poison, andBurnsfor lava.If the lightning quadrant activates, he is preparingLevinstrike Mekhane. This is a proximity-based attack focused on the center of the arena. Move to a corner to take as little damage as possible. This version of the attack is always the first one seen.If the water quadrant activates, he is preparingWell Mekhane. This is a knockback focused on the center of the arena. This is always the second version of the attack to appear.If the poison quadrant activates, he is preparingAcid Mekhane, which will place spread markers on everyone. Players cannot survive more than one of these attacks, so spreading out is crucial. This is always the third version of the attack to appear.If the lava quadrant activates, he is preparingLava Mekhane, which will place a stack marker on a random raid member. This version of the attack will not appear until all others have been seen.Decollation- Heavy raidwide damage.Hell Skewer- Straight line AoE in front of Hesperos.<Direction> Shift- Hesperos puts a marker on the edge of the arena, in the direction indicated. If there is aswordover the marker, he'll do an extremely wide cone attack that hits the entire field.  This attack deals extreme damage and is a one shot kill on anyone who already has a vulnerability stack. If there is acloakover the marker, he'll do a knockback from the marker that hits the entire field.  This attack pushes anyone who isn't directly in front of the marker into the spikes, killing them.Bloodrake- Hesperos drains the aether from everyone, doing moderate raidwide damage. Then he does one of two attacks.Belone Coils- Four meteor circles appear in the center of the arena, each marked with a crossed-out role icon. At least one player must take each meteor, but players who take a meteor matching their role icon will be killed. Each meteor not successfully caught will inflict one vuln stack.Belone Bursts- Green orbs appear around the outskirts of the arena, and each one will tether to a player. Like the meteor circles, these orbs will be marked with anti-role icons. Players must pop orbs of other roles, but each one touched will inflict one stack ofThrice-come Ruin, which will wear off shortly after the mechanic resolves.As the fight progresses, Hesperos will start combiningSetting the StagewithBloodrake, meaning players will have to performPinaxandBelonemechanics simultaneously.Loot1Unsung Blade of Asphodelos(Guaranteed)Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityUnsung Armor of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Gauntlets of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Chausses of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Ring of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityUnsung Armor of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Chausses of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Greaves of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Unsung Ring of AsphodelosOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 3NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityNosferatuMinionN/AABasic1Hic Svnt Leones Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchCould Be Worse I5CompletePandæmonium: Asphodelos.-6.01Could Be Worse II10CompletePandæmonium: Asphodelos5 times.-6.01Could Be Worse III20CompletePandæmonium: Asphodelos10 times.-6.01DialogueHesperos: I have awaited this moment...
