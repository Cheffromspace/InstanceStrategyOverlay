Yet while of Garlean design, the vessel distinctly lacked the bleak outfitting common in the Empire's warmachina. No, this was the Prima Vista, private stage for the Majestic Imperial Theater Company─a troupe having won acclaim across Garlemald for their timeless work, The Zodiac Brave Story. Which begets the question...why are they here? The answer to that question and more lies in the selfsame legend of which they sing.

Once you've memorized the pattern, you'll always know what happens next.
Before pulling, mark the arena with gather points for each alliance. One goes due north, one south-west and one south-east.All phases:
When adds are up, they need to be killed. No exceptions. He starts the fight with several Ice Azers already spawned; they need to be taken out or they'll detonate and leave ice puddles that will hurt you later.Unbind -> White WhisperWhen Mateus casts Unbind, gather up on your alliance's marker.Your first priority is the nearest Aqua Sphere. It needs to pop before the ice dancer gets to it, or you'll have trouble later.Each player should gather two of the blue orbs that appear during this phase, then standoffof the spiraling ice track to avoid getting frozen.The water pillars will turn into Blizzard III pillars if the ice dancer touches them.If three players stand in them, they will disappear.Any Blizzard III pillars that form need to be destroyed ASAP, or the players tethered to it will turn into snowmen once Mateus's cast of White Whisper completes.Rebind -> Dualcast -> Blizzard III + Blizzard IVIf you did the mechanics correctly, there will be at least one safe spot to stand. Run there during the proximity AoE warnings to avoid dying.Healers should prepare large AoE heals to go off after the blizzards land.Suffocation PhaseFlume Toads need to die ASAP.Arena-wide effect causes everyone to get gradually increasing stacks ofBreathless. If the stacks hit 10, you die, no exceptions.Each toad drops an air pocket on death, run through those pockets to drop yourBreathlessstack to 0.Several players will be targeted for line AoE attacks, keep those lines from intersecting the air pockets to avoid popping them.Ultimate PhaseSeveral players will be tethered by ice orbs that will slowly drift toward the tethered player.Don't let them touch you, or you'll die.Keep the tether line pointed away from the raid to avoid hitting people with the narrow cone AoEs the orbs periodically cast.As in phase 1, the Ice Azers need to be killed, while avoiding their AoE bursts.Three Azure Guards will spawn, tank them away from each other or they'll tether to each other and become stronger.Kill the Azure Guards before Mateus's Aether bar fills up or you'll wipe.He repeats the phases in order from this point until killed or wipe.Hashmal, Bringer of OrderBefore pull, place gather markers for each alliance: one south, one northwest, one northeast.Stick with your alliance!This fight is far less forgiving than the previous one.Boss AbilitiesQuake IV- Raid-wide AoE, heal through.Jagged Edge- Red circles that target and follow a random player, avoid and keep moving until they stop appearing.Falling Rocks- Circle AoE, avoid.Rock Cutter- Heavy tankbuster, use mitigation cooldown.Extreme Edge- Boss appears on eastern or western edge of arena with one arm on fire and flies across, burning everything on the flaming side. Look to see whether the north or south side is getting burned, and move to avoid.Sprintis strongly recommended.Earth Hammer- Proximity AoE, look for where the hammers spawn and move to the opposite side of the arena.Control Tower- Towers spawn and then drop when Hashmal cuts them; any players caught underneath die.Command Tower- Big tower rises out of the centre of the arena to lift Hashmal; avoid.Submission Tower- Drops towers in a Y-shaped pattern that leave behind flames; players running through get a persistentBurnseffect.Landwaster- Ultimate. If Hashmal's mana bar is full when this casts, it's a guaranteed wipe.Summon- Summons two golems that grow over time; kill them ASAP.Demolish- Empowers and enlarges golems with each cast.To Dust- Spawns three Sand Spheres that will explode for massive damage if not killed in time.Fight SequenceQuake IV + Jagged EdgeControl Tower, watch for where he cuts them and move to avoidExtreme Edge, move towards the centre and be ready to run for safetyRemember, fire = bad.

He usually uses Extreme Edge after Control Tower, so be ready for that. If you don't kill him before the second set of golems appear, you'll probably wipe.RofocaleThe Area could be divided into back (point of entrance) -> front (opposite, behind Rofocale's spawn point) and left (seen from the point of entrance) -> right.Phase 1:At around 75% HP Rofocale will give a little speech:I walk the shadows. You will not see me until my lance has transfixed your very soul.He then will retreat and 5 copies of him will charge the area. Watch where those copies spawn. Safe spots will be at the right side of the first and left of the last copy.At around 55% - 60% HP Rofocale will do the same move again.That move is probably rather time-based. But he will likely do it two times in phase 1.Phase 2:After the second split (around 55% HP), three Archaeodemons will spawn. The spawn points are at the triangle points around Rofocale's spawn point. That is, 1 behind the spawn and 2 and 3 left/right of the point of entrance, around the two circular floor patterns.Aetherial Acceleration will be accumulated as long as the three adds are alive.Each group must kill one of the Archaeodemons. The area around it will be shielded, so the other groups can't help. Think The World of Darkness - Cloud of Darkness: the 3 cloud adds.Rofocale will circle the area. Getting hit by him will inflict damage and a knockback.This phase will end if:All three Archaeodemons are dead; orAetherial Acceleration has reached 100.At the end of phase 2, Rofocale will continue to circle the area and slowly ride up into the air. At the highest point he will executeHeavenly Subjugationand inflict damage according to the Aetherial Acceleration meter.One can avoid most of the damage by running to the sides of the area.At 100 Aetherial Acceleration, this will be a wipe. Not only will the damage be higher, the charge will also cover a wider area.Phase 3:Trample will now be followed by Cry of Victory.New Abilities:Embrace,Pomp and CircumstanceandDark Geas.Copies of Rofocale will charge the middle of the area. Safe spots are left/right.Dark Geas will be followed by 5 copies of Rofocale charging the area. Safe spots are according to the spawn of the first/last copy.Rofocale AbilitiesCrush Helm:Tank buster.Chariot:Target a random player and charge toward. Stay close to Rofocale because Cry of Victory will follow.Cry of Victory:A large cone shaped AoE, may cover most of the area. Follows Chariot or in phase 3 also Trample. Will deal moderate damage but inflict 1 stack ofVulnerability Up.Crush Weapon:Places AoE circles under some random players.Trample:Performs a roundtrip in a figure 8 or infinity. Safe zone is in the middle of upper/lower part of the 8 or outside of it. Will inflict serious damage, knockback and 1 stack ofDamage Down.Pomp and Circumstance:Large proximity AoE, placed under Rofocale. Will deal moderate damage.Embrace:Places bluish circular AoE around the area, indicating a tendril-like AoE. Getting hit by this will apply a root for 8s and deal a small amount of damage. Mind that the effective AoE radius will be larger than the initial circle.Dark Geas:Rofocale will retreat and place a number of small Dark Circles around the area. Stand close to one and 'activate' it. During this time the raid will be inflicted with aBleedingdebuff. There is a time limit, in which all Dark Circles must be deactivated.Heavenly Subjugation:Ultimate ability. Executed based on the Aetherial Acceleration meter. Run to the sides of the area and avoid most of the damage. At 100 points of Aetherial Acceleration it will deal 300,000 point of damage. As it seems, this damage can not be mitigated.AddArchaeodemon:Ability- Unholy Darkness: Large circular AOE.Ability- Karma: Large cone AOE.Argath ThadalfusThe fight could be separated into 3 main phases:Phase 1:Pre-EmptinessPhase 2:EmptinessPhase 3:Post-EmptinessArgath Thadalfus gives a little speech:I am the truth from which you run!This marks one of the main mechanics of the fight. Argath Thadalfus will either wear the divine or the demon face. The divine face is a white face, the demon face a bluish/black face with red eyes. Argath will also have buff icons according to the face. The important point is to doexactlyas the command demands if he is wearing the divine and theoppositeif he is wearing the demon face.Emptiness: Watch the Emptiness meter - if theShards of Emptinessare not destroyed in time, this will reach 100 and you will wipe.Donottouch the outer edge of the area, if it is glowing bluish. It would apply aTransfigurationdebuff that will kill the player.In phase 3, the secondGnawing Dreadwill be followed by Argath retreating and making the area a death zone. There will be a small circular safe area. Mind that you can only run into the direction of the arrow.Argath will then jump back and useSoulfix.AbilitiesCrush Weapon:Places AoE circles under players.Soulfix:PBAoE around Argath.Fire IV:Area wide moderate AoE.Crippling Blow:Tank buster, significant damage.Trepidation:Places meteor-like circles around the area. Have one (1) player stand in each one (small damage to the player) or suffer moderate area wide AoE damage.Unrelenting:Five cone shaped AoEs with safe zones between them. Always face this AoE away from the MT. Getting hit by this will apply aCravedebuff. Think confusion or similar.Judgment Blade:Places four square AoE marker around the area (more in phase 3). Do not step in them or suffer a strongBleedingdebuff. Two players will be marked with blueish swords. After a few seconds, those player will drop AoEs, that will fire large line-shaped AoEs crosswise.Suggestion:Drop the marker in the middle.Reason:Argath will dropColdbloodsoon after.Coldblood:Proximity AoE, dropped by Argath somewhere. Be as far away as possible.Royal Blood:Argath will summonShades.Suggestion:Stack and AoE ASAP.Empty Soul:Argath will summon 'Shards of Emptiness'.Suggestion:Stack and AoE ASAP.Gnawing Dread:AppliesTemporary Misdirection. The player can only move in the direction of the arrow above their head.CommandsAfter about 3s the command will be executed and the player will be judged. Be sure to do what is expected, or be punished.Failure will result in damage and 1 stack of theUnnerveddebuff.Divine Command: Turn:Divine face- Turn away from the boss.Demon face- Do not turn away from the boss.Divine Command: Flee:Divine face- Continue to move.(ie: running, attacking)Demon face- Stay near Argath. Do not attack and do not move.AddsShade:Tethered to one player each. Destroy as fast as possible. If not destroyed in time, will castUnholy Sacrifice- significant area-wide AoE damage.Shard of Emptiness:Summoned for each player at the position of the player. If not destroyed in time - significant area-wide AoE damage or wipe.DebuffsUnnerved:Suffer more damage per stack. SufferCraveat 3 stacks. Duration 60s, refresh on new stack.Crave:Be turned into a chicken and run away from Argath for 7s.Transfiguration:Hit the outer purple wall and be turned into a zombie for 10s.Unknown if this one can be removed.Attack other player and explode in AoE damage after the 10s.LootSee also:Ivalician Armor (iLvl 330)Mateus, The Corrupt10Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityIvalician Astrologer's BootsFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Astrologer's EyeglassesHead330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's BootsFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's EyeglassesHead330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's BootsFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's MaskHead330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's HeadgearHead330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's ThighbootsFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's HachimakiHead330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's KyahanFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's HachimakiHead330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's KyahanFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's HeadgearHead330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's ThighbootsFeet330CBlue1Hashmal, Bringer of Order20Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityIvalician Astrologer's GlovesHands330CBlue1Ivalician Astrologer's SlopsLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's GlovesHands330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's SlopsLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's GlovesHands330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's SlopsLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's GauntletsHands330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's TrousersLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's KoteHands330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's Tsutsu-hakamaLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's KoteHands330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's Tsutsu-hakamaLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's GauntletsHands330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's TrousersLegs330CBlue1Rofocale30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityIvalician Astrologer's BootsFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Astrologer's TunicBody330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's BootsFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's TunicBody330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's BootsFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's JacketBody330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's ThighbootsFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's TunicBody330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's DogiBody330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's KyahanFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's DogiBody330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's KyahanFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's ThighbootsFeet330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's TunicBody330CBlue1Rofocale CardTriple Triad CardN/A1Argath Thadalfus40Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsNameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityArgath Thadalfus CardTriple Triad CardN/A1Ivalician Astrologer's EyeglassesHead330CBlue1Ivalician Astrologer's GlovesHands330CBlue1Ivalician Astrologer's SlopsLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Astrologer's TunicBody330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's EyeglassesHead330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's GlovesHands330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's SlopsLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Enchanter's TunicBody330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's GlovesHands330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's JacketBody330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's MaskHead330CBlue1Ivalician Fusilier's SlopsLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's GauntletsHands330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's HeadgearHead330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's TrousersLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Lancer's TunicBody330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's DogiBody330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's HachimakiHead330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's KoteHands330CBlue1Ivalician Martialist's Tsutsu-hakamaLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's DogiBody330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's HachimakiHead330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's KoteHands330CBlue1Ivalician Samurai's Tsutsu-hakamaLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's GauntletsHands330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's HeadgearHead330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's TrousersLegs330CBlue1Ivalician Squire's TunicBody330CBlue1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTrisection Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Precipitous Combat Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1Ultima's Transformation Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1RewardsWhen originally released, players could receive only one reward item per week for completing duties in the Royal City of Rabanastre.

In a fateful twist, the attack intended to leave the city in ruins served to reveal the ancient remnants heretofore concealed below.— Game DescriptionCrumbling BridgeA stone thoroughfare leading to the city's main gate, this structure was built to bear the weight of several dozen carriages crossing at the same time. Its sturdiness, however, was no protection against the explosive firepower of the Empire's gunships, and the loss of this escape route resulted in substantial casualties amongst the capital's residents.Muthru BazaarThis market Square inside the entrance to Rabanastre was once filled with bustling stalls. Caravans arriving in the royal capital would conduct their initial business here, unloading crates and other heavy cargo, as merchants set to depart the city packed their carts and wagons with goods for the road ahead.Palace SquareAn expansive plaza stretching out before the palace, this site was reserved for royal weddings, military parades, and other such public events. When the palace chambers were commandeered by the imperial viceroy, however, the square become home to a contingent of watchful Garlean soldiers.North EndRabanastre's residential district. Once awash with the colorful awnings of street-side shops selling inexpensive goods or tavern fare, the Garlean occupation saw the ward emptied and renovated for the exclusive use of imperial citizens.Garamsythe WaterwayStretching far below the streets of Rabanastre, this channel was constructed to carry in water from its source in the Skatay Range to the north. The lattice-like architecture of the waterway is confusing to navigate, and those who lose their sense of direction find it all but impossible to find their way out again.Lesalia Garden RuinsThese ruins of an ancient civilization were discovered deep beneath the earth. Jenomis cen Lexentale, the man who discovered them, insists they are the remnants of the legendary Lesalia, the royal capital of Ivalice, but thorough archeological surveys have yet to be conducted to substantiate his claims.Lesalia Temple RuinsThought to be a monument to the gods of eld, the true nature of this timeworn but impressive edifice-and the religion once practiced within-remains an enigma. Academics eagerly await for calm to prevail in Dalmasca that they might attempt a more accurate appraisal.Additional InformationTheRoyal City of Rabanastrewas once the capital city ofDalmasca, referred to as theJewel of the Desertor theDesert Sapphire. The city acted as a hub for trade, and was known for its hordes of luxurious treasures from different lands all over. The city has been referred to asantediluvianmeaning it most likely stood since at least before theCalamity of Waterover fifteen hundred years ago. Due to the city being so old, it is implied that theB'narginroyal line were not the first rulers ofDalmasca.After theGarlean Empireinvaded and conqueredDalmasca, it was ruled byNoah van Gabranthfor over thirty years. Following the liberation of bothAla MhigoandDoma, many nations under theEmpire'sheel were roused to action, one of them beingRabanastre. However, as a show of force to dissuade other kingdoms and nations from continuing their uprising, theGarlean Empireobliterated the city, completely wiping it out, even though it acted as a major fuel source for their army. This action ended up causing a historic revelation, as it was revealed thatRabanastrewas built upon theLesalia Ruins, confirming thatIvalicewas in fact a real kingdom long ago.TriviaThe story for this raid was written by guest creator Yasumi Matsuno, director and writer of titles such as FINAL FANTASY TACTICS and FINAL FANTASY XII.
