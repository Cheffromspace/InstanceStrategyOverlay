The time has come for action. As Y'shtola and Master Matoya seek to magically sever the primal's death grip on the land, you will take to the skies with Cid in hopes of securing an ingress through the colossus's mighty pate.

It uses a tankbuster cleave that can be mitigated between both tanks.For the encounter withRefurbisher 0, the room is divided into four quadrants. There will be interactablePower Generatorsand dead enemies (scrap metal) on the floor. The goal here is to move the power generators adjacent to the enemies to revive them, so that the off-tank can drag the enemies to a quadrant that will be engulfed in lava. The addsmust be killedbefore the lava appears or the boss will instead be buffed! Any players caught in the lava will be inflicted with a strongBurnsdamage-over-time. Once moved, power generators cannot be moved again.Eventually, aFull Metal Faustadd is spawned, dealing proximity based damage as it arrives. Move away from its spawn point to mitigate. This add has enough HP to survive the first lava zone appearing, and functions as a DPS check. The off-tank needs to moveFull Metal Faustto the opposite corner of where he spawns, as this will be the third quadrant to be consumed in lava. The lava pits spawn much faster during this phase, so moving to the far side should give the party enough time to DPS him down. WhenFull Metal FaustappearsRefurbisher 0becomesinvulnerable, so all damagemustbe focused on Faust. IfFull Metal Faustcontacts lava while still alive the raid will instantlywipe!OnceFull Metal Faustis killed, the boss can be damaged again. Mechanics repeat from this point. IfRefurbisher 0manages to rebuilt all his body components (due to failed add/lava mechanics), the raidwill wipe.Refurbisher 0AbilitiesScrap- A column attack on the main tank. Don't cleave the party.Scrap Burst- Orange markers that drop meteors. Players must hide behind these meteors to avoid damage and aBleedingdamage-over-time debuff from the follow-up attack.Scrapline- Large 270 degree frontal cone AoE. Everyone, tanks included, should move behind the boss for this.Scrapbomb- a stack marker, the entire raid should stand together to share the damage. Healers shield and heal as necessary.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Alexandrian LensOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian SpringOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityTarnished Alexandrian LensOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian CrankOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian PedalOtherN/AABasic1Tarnished Alexandrian BoltOtherN/AABasic1AchievementsThis duty is associated with the followingachievements:NamePointsTaskRewardPatchMapping the Realm: Alexander I10Discover every location withinAlexander - the Eyes of the Creator.-3.4RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
