Here is the cleaned up text for the strategy guide:

The Navel is a level 34 trial introduced in patch 2.0.

Strategy:

Lord of Crags: Titan

The fight is rather straightforward. Titan periodically stomps causing damage to the entire party, but he sticks to melee attacks on his primary target until 80% HP. 

At 80%, Titan will jump in the air and leave the battlefield, only to return a few seconds later doing massive AoE damage and destroying the walls around the platform. A red ring will take up the outer edge, indicating where the ground will crumble away. Standing as close to the ring as possible will also reduce the damage taken from the attack. Titan will then gain the ability to send out a large shockwave in a line that will knock players off the platform to their death. There is plenty of time to dodge this attack and it should always be avoided. 

At around 50%, Titan will leap into the air once again and come back down dealing damage. Shortly thereafter, Titan's heart will be exposed and Titan himself will no longer be attackable. Titan's heart needs to be killed as fast as possible to prevent the upcoming enrage from wiping the party. At this point, he also gains the ability to encase a party member in a rock tomb similar to the bubble mechanic from Hellbender in Brayflox's Longstop, though the tomb will not allow the CC'd person to cast spells unlike the bubble, so it's best to clear this quickly.

Once the heart has been destroyed, Titan gains one final ability on top of all his previous ones to call down rocks from the ceiling. He will also use his stomp twice in succession. Aside from the one new ability, Titan is easily killed after his heart has been destroyed. Avoiding the falling rocks, dodging his shockwave, and quickly freeing other party members are the keys to staying alive and defeating him. In this phase, Titan has an attack rotation. He will cast the rock tomb (gaol) two punches after every landslide.
