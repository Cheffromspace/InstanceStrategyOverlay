- Bomb Boulders: Spawns numerous bombs around the boss room that explode in the order they dropped, dealing heavy damage to nearby players.
- Rock Throw: Spawns a clock-like symbol under a random player. After a few seconds, the marked player is encased in a Granite Gaol and cannot move or attack until freed by other players attacking the Gaol.
- Earthen Fury: Titan's ultimate ability. Instantly kills all players if Titan's Heart is not destroyed before the end of the phase. Does moderate damage if the heart is destroyed in time.

Tips
1. Prioritize dodging Landslide to avoid being knocked off the stage. 
2. During Geocrush, stay inside the red circle to avoid falling off, but stand near the front of the line to take less damage.
3. Watch the order the rock boulders spawn to know which order they will explode and dodge them.
4. Players can now be resurrected if they fall off.
