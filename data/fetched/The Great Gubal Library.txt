Here is the cleaned up strategy guide for The Great Gubal Library dungeon in Final Fantasy 14:

The Great Gubal Library is a level 59 dungeon introduced in patch 3.0 with Heavensward. 

Bosses:

The Demon Tome
- Casts an AOE down the middle of the room, then the sides. Causes a slowing effect if hit.
- Casts Dark Blizzard III, a circle AOE targeting a random player. 
- Periodically casts Disclosure and begins to glow. Run to the back side of the tome to avoid instant death.
- After a while, casts Words of Winter, freezing the ground. Move carefully in the direction you want to go to slide past.

Byblos
- Periodically becomes invulnerable. Kill the adds that spawn from books to draw an orb tether. Pull the orb into Byblos to break his invulnerability. 
- Spawns clouds of oil fumes that cause damage and knockback. Take turns moving through them carefully.
- Uses Gale Cut, a frontal attack. Avoid by running through or to the side.
- Uses Tail Swipe when someone is behind him. 
- Targets a random player with Head Down, a damaging charge attack. Damage is shared between all players hit.

The Everliving Bibliotaph
- At intervals, begins casting Void Summon. Stand on the glowing platforms to cancel the summons. 1 player for 1 light, 2 for 2 lights, 3 for 3 lights. Failing spawns a voidsent add.
- Marks players with targets. Run to the side to bait the AOE. Avoid the void spark left behind.
- After the 2nd Void Summon, casts Deep Darkness on the outside (heavy damage and debuff) followed by Magic Burst on the inside (damage and knockback).

The dungeon contains several treasure coffers with additional loot. It also has many lore entries found in books throughout detailing Garlean hierarchy, elements, Merlwyb's expeditions, and other topics.
