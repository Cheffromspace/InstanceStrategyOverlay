The raid is also known asA11S.Contents1Strategy1.1Cruise Chaser1.2Phase 11.3Phase 21.4Phase 31.5Phase 42Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 2StrategyCruise ChaserThis is another fight that requires players to pay attention to what the boss is doing in order to dodge mechanics or stand in the correct place to make sure mechanics resolve properly.Phase 1Left/Right Laser Sword: The boss will telegraph what side the attack will come out on, and the entire side of the stage the boss is attacking will be hit by an AoE. Move to the safe side.Optical Sight: This attack has ‘tells’ that reveal what type of attack is coming out next:Pattern 1: Two large orbs: The center of the room will be bombed, so players need to move to the edge to avoid.Pattern 2: Small orbs evenly spaced: Random players will be targeted by the Hawk Blasters. Players should stack in the center to bait the AoEs, then spread out to avoid.Pattern 3: Small orbs unevenly spaced: Two blasts will drop on opposite sides of the arena and rotate around the arena going clockwise, then finally drop in the center. Players should stay in the center, then dodge out to avoid the final hit.E.D.D: This ad should be picked up by the off tank. Players need to destroy its armor in order to disrupt its cast ofOverboost, which gives a massiveDamage Upbuff. The ad can be burned down at this point.Spin Crusher: A fixed-direction frontal cleave. Move behind the boss to avoid.Whirlwind: High raid-wide damage, Mitigate and heal through.Optical Sight: Random players are marked bySuper Hawk Blastersand have large AoEs spawn under them. Players need to spread out to avoid stacking damage, as the attack also debuffs withMagic Vulnerability Up, meaning getting hit by more than one blast will kill the player.These mechanics will repeat until the boss reaches 75% HP.Phase 2Limit Cut: The boss becomes invulnerable, receives aDamage Upbuff, and proceeds with mechanics.Numbers: Players are numbered 1-8. Odd numbered players are blue, even numbered players are red. Players should pair up in numerical order (1 pairs with 2, etc.).Alpha Sword: The boss spawns behind odd numbered players and casts a frontal cone. Odd numbered players should look away from the center of the room.Super Blassty Charge: A line charge from odd player to their even partner. Even players will receive knockback if they are facing away but won't if they are facing the attack.To handle these mechanics, players should assign a location on the arena to handle these attacks. Odd players should stand near the edge facing away from the arena, while the even player should stand at the edge facing them. The boss will attack pairs in order, so once a pair group handles their attack, other players can move in. After these attacks resolve the boss will be targetable again.Photon: Reduces players HP to single digits. Healers need to top them off quickly as the boss follows this up withWhirlwind, followed by anotherLaser Sword.Blast Off: The boss will leap into the air from the center of the arena, knocking players back.Ductswill open on the arena and players will have to quickly interact with them in order to be knocked onto the boss's back. The boss will then take off and destroy the arena, killing anyone who didn't get to a duct fast enough. He will move to another arena that is surrounded by electricity. Players will jump off and there will be a massive AoE in the center to avoid the boss landing.Phase 3Limit Cut: Like last time the boss will become invincible and receive aDamage Upbuff. He will then spawn 4 large orbs.Lapis Lazuli: These orbs must be destroyed before the boss castsEternal Darkness. While burning down the orbs the boss will be using various attacks.Laser X Sword: Heavy-hitting tankbuster that must be split between both the main tank and off tank, and both must use cooldowns to survive.Aetheroplasm: Random players are tethered to orbs that spawn off the arena and slowly move towards who they're tethered to. The further the orbs have to travel, the less damage they deal to their respective player. When they reach their player, they drop a puddle. These don't deal damage, but if a second puddle is placed on top of them, they explode and wipe the raid.Assualt Cannons: Fire line AoEs, simply move out of the way of these.Eternal Darkness: If all theLapis Lazuliare dead by the time this goes off, The attack will deal damage and aPyreticdebuff. Simply shield and heal through. If the orbs aren't dead however, this will be a wipe.Pyretic: This debuff will deal 500HP of damage per action a player takes. Players need to be aware of their HP and be careful not to die. This debuff will last the next time the boss usesBlast Offaround 45% HP.The mechanics for this phase will repeat withWhirlwind,Spin CrusherandOptical Sight. The boss will also cycle throughPhoton,Laser X Sword, summoning anE.D.Dad, anotherPhoton/Whirlwindcombo, and aLaser Sword.
Depending on your DPS in this phase you may see the boss use anotherLimit Cut. The boss will become invincible again and spawn aPlasma Shieldthat can only be attacked from the front.
The boss can also use aSuper Blassty Charge, this time however it will inflict a heavy debuff on everyone that is hit, so players should spread out.Phase 4The boss will useBlast Offonce again, players will interact with the ducts once again and enter the new arena with threeMultifield Pillars. These can be hit by both players and the boss's attacks via incidental damage. If all three are destroyed, the platform will collapse.GA-100: The off tank is marked for a blast, and the attack deals proximity damage. The off tank has to move to one side of the arena, while the rest of the party moves to the other side.The boss will follow up with twoOptical Sightcasts, so evade accordingly, being careful not to hit any of the pillars with AoE damage from theSuper Hawk Blasts. The boss will use anotherLaser X Swordattack, andAssault Canonswill spawn, firing line AoEs around the arena that players have to avoid.
AnotherPhoton/Whirlwindcombo comes out, then the boss usesPropeller Wind, which confuses every player it hits. To avoid this attack, players need to get behind one of the pillars to break the Line of Sight of this attack to survive.Limit Cut: This version of the attack is the exact same as the first one, players must simply be careful around the pillars.From here, the mechanics repeat. The boss will use anotherLimit Cutand summon aPlasma Shieldfor players to burn down and will also useSuper Blassty Charge. Be warned, one hit of this attack will destroy the pillars. The fight will continue until either the players defeat the boss, or it enrages, and the party is wiped.Loot30Allagan Tomestone of PoeticsAlexandrian Manifesto - Page 3Treasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAlexandrian Leg Gear Coffer (IL 270)OtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityAlexandrian Head Gear Coffer (IL 270)OtherN/AABasic1Alexandrian Hand Gear Coffer (IL 270)OtherN/AABasic1Alexandrian Foot Gear Coffer (IL 270)OtherN/AABasic1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
