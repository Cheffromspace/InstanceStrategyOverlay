According to Nero's analysis, your next opponent is capable of manipulating gravity, and by way of a countermeasure, he sends you off with one of his curious contraptions: an anti-gravity gimbal.— In-game descriptionDeltascape V2.0is a level 70raidintroduced inpatch 4.01withStormblood. The raid is also known asO2N.Contents1Strategy1.1Catastrophe2Loot2.1Treasure Coffer 12.2Treasure Coffer 2StrategyDeltascape v2.0 GuideCatastropheThe boss has lots of abilities so you need to keep an eye on its cast bar to know what to do for each ability. Most of the abilities he uses will revolve around the duty action "Anti Gravity Gimbal" - when used this will cause you to levitate above the arena. It is best to start the fight levitating to avoid the tremors and earthquake which are always used first.Earthquake– Arena wide AOE attack that hits the entire party for a large amount of damage. Avoid this by levitating.Paranormal Wave- Frontal conal cleave - keep the boss facing away from the raid.Evilsphere- Moderate damage tank buster attack.Demon Eye– Turn away before the boss finishes its cast of this. If you're facing it when it finishes you will gain aVulnerability Upstack. (Quite often this is used alongside Antilight)100G- This will cancel your levitation.Antilight- This move will have 1 of 3 outcomes:Purple orbs covering the arena floor - levitate to avoid themGold orbs above the arena - make sure to stay on the groundBoth purple and gold orbs together (this one usually appears if everyone is already levitating) - go to the center of the arena. There is a safe zone there from the purple orbs. The boss will cast 100G before the gold orbs explode, dropping you down into the safe zone.Aetherial Rift- This move will slowly make you sink into the arena - use your duty action to levitate and avoid this. (It may be cast just after gold Antilight so you need to let them explode before levitating).Gravitational Explosion- This move will make one player levitate and also ready stacking damage AoE on them. Everyone needs to levitate and stack with that player to share the damage (you won't share the damage if you're not levitating).Maniacal Probe– This summons 4 tentacles in the cardinal directions on the arena with a corruption AoE around them. Once they spawn they will have a blue arrow-like icon on them. It will be followed by him castingEpicenter- Shortly after this is cast you need to look for the tentacle that no longer has the blue icon and move to stand directly on top of it. The remaining with a blue icon will then cast a massive circle AoE dealing huge damage. Each subsequent time this Maniacal Probe/Epicenter rotation is used there will be one more tentacle that keeps its blue icon.-100G- This move will spawn 4 purple and gold antilights on top of each other. There will be two safe zones from them at opposite ends of the arena. Shortly after the boss will fling everyone into the air, dealing around 10-15k damage on landing. Healers need to be ready with AoE heals as he will also follow up with another couple of high damage AoE hits following the landing.LootTreasure Coffer 1NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDeltascape LensOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape ShaftOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape PedalOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape BoltOtherN/AABasic1Treasure Coffer 2NameTypeItem LevelRarityQuantityDeltascape CrankOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape SpringOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape PedalOtherN/AABasic1Deltascape BoltOtherN/AABasic1Omega Squared Orchestrion RollOrchestrion RollN/AABasic1RaidsA Realm Reborn(Lv. 50)AllianceThe Labyrinth of the Ancients•Syrcus Tower•The World of DarknessFull PartyThe Binding Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4|Turn 5)The Second Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1/Savage|Turn 2/Savage|Turn 3/Savage|Turn 4/Savage)The Final Coil of Bahamut(Turn 1|Turn 2|Turn 3|Turn 4)Heavensward(Lv. 60)AllianceThe Void Ark•The Weeping City of Mhach•Dun ScaithFull PartyAlexander: Gordias(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: Midas(Fist/Savage|Cuff/Savage|Arm/Savage|Burden/Savage)Alexander: The Creator(Eyes/Savage|Breath/Savage|Heart/Savage|Soul/Savage)Stormblood(Lv. 70)AllianceThe Royal City of Rabanastre•The Ridorana Lighthouse•The Orbonne MonasteryFull PartyOmega: Deltascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Sigmascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)Omega: Alphascape(V1.0/Savage|V2.0/Savage|V3.0/Savage|V4.0/Savage)The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate)•The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)Shadowbringers(Lv. 80)AllianceThe Copied Factory•The Puppets' Bunker•The Tower at Paradigm's BreachFull PartyEden's Gate(Resurrection/Savage|Descent/Savage|Inundation/Savage|Sepulture/Savage)Eden's Verse(Fulmination/Savage|Furor/Savage|Iconoclasm/Savage|Refulgence/Savage)Eden's Promise(Umbra/Savage|Litany/Savage|Anamorphosis/Savage|Eternity/Savage)The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)Endwalker(Lv. 90)AllianceAglaia•Euphrosyne•ThaleiaFull PartyPandæmonium: Asphodelos(First/Savage|Second/Savage|Third/Savage|Fourth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Abyssos(Fifth/Savage|Sixth/Savage|Seventh/Savage|Eighth/Savage)Pandæmonium: Anabaseios(Ninth/Savage|Tenth/Savage|Eleventh/Savage|Twelfth/Savage)Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)•The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)Dawntrail(Lv. 100)AllianceTBAFull PartyTBAFutures Rewritten (Ultimate)DutiesDungeons•Guildhests•Trials•Raids•PvP•Quest Battles•Treasure Hunt•Deep Dungeons•Field Operations•Variant and Criterion Dungeons•Gathering Forays•The Gold Saucer•Hall of the Novice•Stone, Sky, Sea•The Masked Carnivale
