Ephemeral Justice: Themis
Throughout fight, boss will either have purple or gold rings (basically move close and move away respectively)
Eunomia: raidwide with bleed
Divisive Ruling: large line aoe from center. Move into aoe right after goes off if purple (like Rubicante's Flamereake), or farther away toward edge if gold
Dark and Light: creates gold and purple circles on floor for next mechanic
Sigils of Discord: Stand in opposite color circle of your debuff to avoid continual heavy damage
Dineis: stack towards center in your circle to bait 2 sets of aoes and move away
Emissary's Will: raidwide that removes light/dark debuffs
Dismissal Ruling: knockback followed by donut (if purple) or pointblank aoe (if gold). Knockback immunity works here
Dike: dual tankbusters
Light/dark circles reappear and are combined with previous abilities, leaving less room to maneuver
Upheld Ruling: if purple, large tankbuster aoe tethered to a tank followed by donut aoe within boss's hitbox. If gold, be stack marker followed by point blank aoe where boss jumps. In either case, tether cannot be changed or broken
Styx: multihit group stack
Dineis into Dismissal Ruling: same abilities as before
Shadowed Messenger: cross line aoes from cardinal clones followed by color mechanics - move to intercardinals initially to dodge, then move to be in front of where purple clone was
Blinding Light: spread aoes on all
