This phase begins with two adds
Tail Slap - wide frontal cleave
Inner Demons - gaze attack
Stotram - Add heal from Lakshmi and raid-wide damage
After the adds are down, Lakshmi becomes targetable
Lakshmi will cast abilities in the following order:
Hand of Grace - Telegraphed AoE
The Pull of Light - Tankbuster (cast simultaneously with Hand of Grace)
Stotram
The Pull of Light
The Path of Light - Large frontal cleave centered on player with second highest aggro (marked with a blue marker)
Alluring Arm - One + AoE, and two lily pads
The Pull of Light
Stotram
The Pall of Light - Stack on the marked player to share damage
The Pull of Light
Chanchala - Massive ability buff
After Chanchala, Lakshmi's abilities are altered and her damage is substantially increased
The next abilities will be cast in Lakshmi's first Chanchala form in the following order:
Divine Denial - Raid-wide knockback, will kill anyone not using Vril
Hand of Beauty - Telegraphed AoE on bother healers
The Pull of Light - Substantially more damage, Vril to avoid death
The Path of Light - Substantially more damage, Vril to avoid death
Divine Desire - Raid-wide pull and bleed AoE in the center of the arena (Vril negates pull)
After Divine Desire, Lakshmi returns to her regular form and resumes her regular abilities
Her next rotation is as follows:
The Pull of Light
The Path of Light
Stotram
At around 50% HP, Lakshmi becomes untargetable and the add phase begins

Second Phase - Adds
Once Lakshmi becomes untargetable, she'll summon four Dreamer adds: two Brahmin and two Shudra
Water III - Telegraphed AoE
One add will be marked with a blue Vril bubble
This bubble rotates to a different add every 10 seconds
Every add with Vril that's killed will replenish players' Vril by 1
Players will need to kill 3 adds to fully replenish Vril (Vril won't be restored until at least 3 adds are killed with the bubble on them)
Lakshmi will cast her ultimate once the gauge reaches 0 regardless if adds remain on the field
After her ultimate, her final phase begins

Third Phase
After her ultimate, Lakshmi immediately begins her final phase with Chanchala:
Divine Doubt - Raid-wide confuse (Vril lowers confuse time)
The Path of Light
The Pull of Light
Lakshmi drops her Chanchala form and begins glowing gold:
Vril Restoration (Z and Straight)
The Pull of Light
The Pall of Light
Alluring Arm - Two crosses and two lily pads
The Path of Light
Stotram
Lakshmi then enters Chanchala once more:
Divine Doubt
The Pall of Light - Stack to mitigate damage, pop Vril to avoid bleed debuff
Vril Restoration (Circle and Z)
Divine Desire - Cast at the same time as the Vril Restoration
Vril Restoration (Circle and Z)
Stotram - Pop Vril to survive, will kill those with bleed debuff or not topped off on HP
Lakshmi drops Chanchala and starts begins her final rotation:
Alluring Arm
The Pall of Light
The Path of Light
After some time, if Lakshmi is still not dead, she will soft enrage by using Chanchala
If she is still not killed, Lakshmi will hard enrage and cast Divine Desire until the party wipes
