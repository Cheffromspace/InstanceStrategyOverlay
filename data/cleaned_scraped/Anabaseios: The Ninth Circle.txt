Phases & Abilities
Mythic Creation: Kokytos
Gluttony's Augur: raidwide damage
Ravening: signals phase transition based on boss color (icy blue, red, or green)

Mage phase
Fire III: 4 players get spread markers, will expand before going off - move to far edge of arena ideally to create middle safespot
Blizzard III: donut aoe centered around boss, will shrink before going off
Dualspell: both basic fire and blizzard aoes, but one element will flash on screen and have its secondary effect happen (expanding spread markers or shrinking donut)
Global Spell: raidwide with bleed
Iceflame Summoning(from cycle 2 onwards): drops 2 fire and 2 ice rocks. One element will flash and the same rocks will grow - get opposite of those rocks

Fighter phase
Archaic Rockbreaker: knockback from center (stand outside blue). Lava lines of varying speeds/distance travel from center and emit point blank aoes when they stop, similar to Ruby Weapon's Ravenclaw
Archaic Demolish: 2 group stack markers (ideally 4 players in each)
Ascendant Fist: tankbuster
Front/Rear Combination: either large or donut aoe, then large half-room cleave in direction indicated by ability

Behemoth phase
Charybdis: marked players drop puddle aoes, will inflict dot if stood in
Beastly Roar: knockback from center with spread aoes (be mindful of spread markers and puddles). Knockback immunity works here
Pulverizing Pounce: group stack
Gluttonous Rampage: dual tankbuster tethers (stretch to turn purple instead of reddish with arrows) with proximity aoe from center. Ideally tanks take NW and NE, rest of party goes S
Comet: triple proximity aoes, head to one safe side, then get to the one uncracked rock that drops
Ecliptic Meteor: drops meteor in center - hide behind uncracked rock, then move away from rock after meteor goes off as rock will explode in pointblank aoe

Mechanics/phases seem to repeat from here
