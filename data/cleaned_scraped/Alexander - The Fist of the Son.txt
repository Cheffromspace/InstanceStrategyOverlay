The Fist of the Son Guide
Note: This is one of the very few normal difficulty duties where a tank swap is recommended to safely resolve a mechanic.

Ratfinx Twinkledinks
Tank the boss in the corner to make it easier to avoid the very large AOE from bombs.
When the boss changes to his giant form, he will apply a debuff 4x, stunning the main tank on 4th and then wind up for a tankbuster. Off-tank should temporarily provoke the boss at 4 to intercept the tankbuster. After recovering, the MT can then takes the boss back, or the tanking can hard swap on each Concussion, depending on the group's preference.
Adds will spawn in the corners of the room; they need to be tanked.
If you get a red-orange marker over your head, run away from the party. This will drop a large puddle which deals significant damage to anyone standing in it.
The tower in the center of the room has a purple circle around it. Standing near the circle brings up two puddles on the sides of the room, which are necessary for countering certain boss abilities.  Standing near the tower too long will inflict damage, however, so the circle should be avoided except to spawn the puddles.
Red puddle will turn you into a gorilla, giving you a skill to knock bombs far away from the party before they explode. More bombs will spawn each time he summons them (first one, then two, then three).  The explosion radius is just slightly smaller than the width of the arena, so ideally the bombs should be pushed into the corner opposite where the boss and party are at.  If they are pushed into an adjacent corner or against a wall, ensure you hug the opposite wall tightly to avoid the explosion.
The violet puddle will turn you into a bird. When the boss is extra large and uses "Boost", become a bird or you'll likely die to his multiple groundpound attacks. Skill #1 allows you to do a little damage, skill #2 will turn you back into yourself.
