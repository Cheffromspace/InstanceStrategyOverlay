Players must first complete all of the Bahamut Quests up through Alisaie's Resolve. This includes clearing all of the The Binding Coil of Bahamut and The Second Coil of Bahamut raids. Players can then begin the level 50 quest Fragments of Truth by talking to Urianger (x6, y4) in The Waking Sands.

Players may proceed to any of the four floors in this raid tier after unlocking them, although the floors are intended to be done in order for story purposes. To continue the questline, complete The Final Coil of Bahamut - Turn 4 to unlock Alisaie's Path, the final quest.

The Final Coil of Bahamut - Turn 2: Kaliya  
The Final Coil of Bahamut - Turn 3: Phoenix
The Final Coil of Bahamut - Turn 4: Bahamut Prime
