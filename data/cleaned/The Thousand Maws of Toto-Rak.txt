Graffias
There are puddles of green goo surrounding the arena that inflict the Leaden debuff, slowing players' movement.
Realm Shaker: An instant circle AoE around the boss that deals moderate damage.
Silkscreen: A line AoE targeting a random player.
Sticky Web: Graffias targets a random player, dealing minor damage and spawning an untargetable Fleshy Pod add at their position. After a few seconds, the add explodes with Pod Burst, dealing moderate damage in a circle AoE and inflicting any players hit with a Poison debuff.
At 50% HP, the boss will summon 4 Comesmite adds, and the skin on its tail will fall off as an additional target, unlocking another attack. Killing the tail will remove the attack and give the boss Vulnerability Up for 60 seconds.
Deadly Thrust: A player will be targeted and a large green poison puddle will be placed at their position that inflicts a Pollen debuff, dealing damage over time to any players standing inside of it.
