Halicarnassus
Phases:
Standard Panels
Forest Panels
Cave Panels
Library Panels
Final Phase - Mixed panels

Core Mechanics
Critical Hit - High Damage tank buster. Always crits. Tanks take awareness kill
Spellblade:Holy: 3 AOE's + Stack. Boss will also cast Pole Shift which switches the tethered players positions. In this case have party stack with the player tethered to stack mechanic, and have other 2 tethers spread away from these.
During Libary phase: You will receive 2 stacks and 4 AOEs. To handle this you have the 4 AOEs go in 1 Green Book each granting physical vun down. The 2 stacks and 2 unmarked will go into Blue Books, granting magic vun down. This enables the stacks to be soaked by 2 players.
Fire 3: AOE around the boss, under the boss is safe.
Blizzard 3: AOE around boss, dodge out.
Thunder 3: Line AOE.
Panel Swap: Changes arena type, also changes effect of next mechanic:
Queen's Waltz: Effect changes on the panel she is stood in. Effects are introduced in order, but later will switch based on where she jumps too.
Plain area: Casts the A3S protean wave mechanic targeting all players with conal AOEs. Spread around boss and don't overlap other players.
Forest: Boss casts T6 Thorny vines tethering tanks/healers with DPS. Run apart with Tanks/healers going one way , DPS the other
Cave: Casts pillars in non-blue tiles ala normal mode. Comes with raid wide AOE dmg.
Library: Each player takes a non-booked panel, at the end of the cast a book falls on each player dealing ½ max HP.
Haste: Increases cast time of next mechanic.
Haste 3: Increases cast time for set duration. Final phase only.
Dimensional Wave: Medium raid wide AOE DMG
Playing field: Swaps tiles on arena to DPS/Tank/Healer, and later Pig/Frog/Imp. All must be stood on, by correct player type.
The Game: Triggers playing fields.
Oink: Red Triangles. Stack to prevent turning into pigs.
Ribbit: Conal AOE in front of boss. Turns you into frog.
Squelch: Look away mechanic, turns you into imp if looking at boss.
Place Token: Spawns adds based on phase. All adds hit very hard.
Forest Phase: White Flame- DPS down ASAP, tank boss away as she continues to do circular AOE's
Cave: Spawns greater dragon. OT picks up and tanks it near boss within blue panels.
Library: Spawns Apanda, hits hard, casts Magic Hammer which creates circular AOE's under players.
Final Phase: Spawns Iron Giant + Ninjas. Need to be tanked seperately, MT picks up giant, OT ninjas. Mage LB these and burn down before they wipe raid.
Mind Jack: Gives players forward/left/right/retreat marches later causing them to run in that direction based on where they are facing. Will be paired with other mechanics.
Waltz (Thorns + Spellblade Fire 3): DPS position to run south. Tanks and healers run north. This breaks vines and takes players out of AOE.
Dark Tokens: In final phase mindjack is paired with dark tokens, you must face so you remain within central 4 squares, and so that mindjack makes you on the opposite corner to the token you are tethered with. This maximizes the tether distance so it doesn't kill the player.
Place Dark token: First time you see during the cave phase this it will spawn 4 reapers on the outer edges that deal line AOE dmg, and 1 reaper in the centre. One of the blue panels will be a safe spot. This can be found as no reapers will line up with the panel.
