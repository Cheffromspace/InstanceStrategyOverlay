Xelphatol Bosses Guide (Updated for 6.3)

Nuzal Hueloc
Wind Blast - path aoe
Lifthe jumps up and summons 3 adds, kill turret first
Air Raid - party wide aoe
Hot Air - party wide aoe cast by the turrets, it throws everyone up
Airstone - an add tethered to the boss or turret, kill asap
Long Burst - unavoidable, targets random player
When 4 airstones appear tethered to a turret, kill the airstones first. Otherwise, kill turrets first.
After the turret's health reaches 0, it will begin casting Hot Air. During the cast, players should position themselves underneath Nuzal which will bring him down after the cast is complete.

Dotoli Ciloc
On low - frontal cleave
On high - party wide aoe with push back, stand with your back to the barriers or you will fall in the spike pit
Dark wingstar - targets random player and spawns windy aoe in their place, move out
Terrible fury - marks a random player and aoe blasts them, move away
Swiftfeather - Causes the next On Low to be almost instant. On Low is used right after. Cannot be dodged to the side as the cast is instant, so tank must move away from the boss preemptively to dodge.

Tozol Huatotl

Ixali Aero II - path aoe
Hawkre - solves to either a stack marker or a spread marker
Summon Garuda - he summons untargetable Garuda, she fires a room wide aoe with some safe areas and marks everyone with green crystals and aoe rings, spread out
