## Void Soulcounter (Demon)
- Appears after the destruction of each sealed barrier

## Galvanth the Dominator (Soulflayer)
- **Mind Blast**: AoE spell that will paralyze anyone caught in it. *Move out of the giant red circle* before he casts it.
- Summons adds 3 times:
  1. An imp that shoots fireballs
  2. An imp, skeletons, and mitelings
  3. Two imps, skeletons, and mitelings
- *Prioritize killing the imps quickly* before the other adds, as they will interrupt spell casting and make Galvanth immune to damage.
- After killing the imps in the 3rd wave, *use AoE Limit Break* on the remaining adds and possibly the boss.
