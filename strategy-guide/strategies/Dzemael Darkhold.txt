Walkthrough:
In the first section of the dungeon, to avoid high damage of the untelegraphed Eyes on Me AoE from the roaming All-seeing Eye (ahriman), stand on the purple ground near the glowing crystals to receive the Crystal Veil buff, which will reduce damage taken by 90%. This buff also enables one to pull all enemies in the first section of the dungeon to the room before the first boss, without much risk. 

In the second and third sections, the orange corrupted crystals will occasionally pulse telegraphed point-blank AoEs that should be avoided.

Stand in blue Magitek circles until the countdown is completed to open doors. Some of them will be within range of the orange crystal AoEs, so heal through the damage. Having more people in the timers makes them faster, but with diminishing returns--they take 20 seconds with one person, 10s with two or three, and 7.5 with four.

Bosses:

All-seeing Eye
Fight the All-seeing Eye near the crystal clusters to gain the Crystal Veil buff. When "The power of the crystal begins to dim" appears on screen, move to a new crystal cluster immediately. The All-seeing Eye is invulnerable to attack except when it is near a cluster of crystals.

Abilities:
- Dread Gaze is a frontal cone AoE attack that inflicts the debuff Paralysis to all targets hit. 
- Cursed Gaze is a frontal cone AoE attack that inflicts the debuff Amnesia to all targets hit.
- Eyes on Me is an ability that deals heavy damage all players near the All-seeing Eye. Players under the effect of Crystal Veil are immune to this damage.

Taulurd  
Throughout the fight he will summon adds named Deepvoid Slaves. These monsters are on top of an elevated platform. They will perform ranged attacks at the players. Be sure to spread out and avoid their Firewater attacks.

Abilities:
- Straight Punch is an instant melee attack that deals a small amount of damage.
- Double Smash is a frontal AoE cone attack that deals a large amount of damage to targets hit. 
- Elbow Drop is a frontal AoE cone attack that deals more damage than Double Smash. Taulurd starts to use this when it is under half HP.

Batraal
This demon has an instant frontal AoE cone attack that deals heavy damage to all targets hit. Be sure to have only the tank in front of the boss. He has a long ranged AoE column attack named Desolation that does extremely high damage and will instantly kill most players.

Throughout the fight, a purple beam will appear between Batraal and a crystal. Batraal will mark a player with a crosshair and fires Desolation at the target every few seconds. While Batraal is connected to the crystal, he is invulnerable. Be sure to kill the crystal as soon as possible while dodging Desolations. The player who was targeted should avoid aiming the Desolations at the rest of the party.

At around 30% HP and after the 3rd crystal is destroyed, Batraal will use Hellssend and become enraged. He will start using Desolation at will. Batraal will also spawn black pools under 3 players. Players within the pool will take damage over time. Move out of them immediately. The puddles will occasionally explode and deal high damage to anyone standing in them.

Tips:
- Avoid Desolation at all cost, since it will instantly kill most players
- If you are targeted, don't point Desolation at the rest of the party
- Kill crystals when they appear. The crystal activate in a set pattern at set percentages of the boss's HP.

Abilities:  
- Grim Fate is an instant frontal attack that deals heavy damage to a single player.
- Grim Cleaver is an instant ranged attack that deals moderate amount of damage to a random player.
- Grim Halo is an instant attack that deals moderate amount of damage to all players around him.
- Desolation is an frontal AoE column that deals very heavy damage to all players caught within.
