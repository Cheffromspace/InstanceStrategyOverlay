Strategy:

Lord of the Hive: Ravana
Ravana (Extreme) is split into multiple phases and follows a set rotation for most phases. Ravana can be 1 tanked.

Ravana will switch between 3 different stances through the fight: Dragonfly, Scorpion and Beetle. Each stance has their own set of abilities. Prior to starting the fight, waymark the arena with A, B, C, A being North, B East, C South and remembering unmarked is D (West).

Dragonfly Abilities:
- Blinding Blade: High damage frontal cleave. 
- The Seeing X: Places a barrier on 3 sides of Ravana, hitting the barrier damages, knocks back and slows players.
- Atma-Linga: Raid-wide AoE.
- Tapasya: Frontal cone cleave that hits 3 times.
- Warlord Shell: Shields himself, must be broken before it wears off or wipe.
- Bloody Fuller/Chandrahas: Ultimate ability.

Scorpion Abilities: 
- Prelude to Liberation: Point blank AoE, linear AoEs, circle AoEs causing Burn debuff, purple circles on players that explode.
- Liberation: AoE everywhere except behind him, jumps and clones himself, charges across arena.
- Swift Liberation: 4 players marked with swords, must run to waymarks. Ravana rushes between them. X AoE on ground causes Burn. Purple circles appear.
- Final Liberation: 2 players marked with Prey, Ravana rushes them. Handle with tank using Cover or splitting Prey targets. Room-wide AoEs with safe spots.

Beetle Abilities:
- Pillars of Heaven: Raid-wide knockback AoE based on proximity. 
- Laughing Rose: Marked player gets meteor AoE, share damage.
- Prey/Surpanakha: Marked player must pass Prey to tank. Ravana focuses them with frontal cone AoE.
- Rose of Conviction: 4 tethered orbs follow players and explode. Stack and run together.
- Rose of Hate: Linear AoE on main tank.

The guide then goes through the phase rotations and mechanics in detail. Key points:

- Handle adds in Dragonfly phase before Ravana's ultimate or take high damage
- Use DPS cooldowns in Scorpion phase during Liberation casts
- Pass Prey to tanks and rotate Ravana during Beetle phase 
- Use LB3 during Swift or Final Liberation
- Aim to kill in 2nd Beetle phase before enrage in final Scorpion phase
