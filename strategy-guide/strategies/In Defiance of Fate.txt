Journal:
Zero's cool expression cannot hide the fire in her eyes.

Owing to Chai-Nuzz's support, you are assured that the Eulmorans will not protest your plan to gather Light at the Crystarium. With no further business to attend to in the city, you set your sights on the Rak'tika Greatwood, where you will meet with Runar in Slitherbough.

Runar declares that while the Night's Blessed hold Darkness in the highest, their beliefs would not move them to object to your plan. Yet while there is no need to persuade the people of Slitherbough, the Ronso wishes to welcome your party properly, and asks that you recite the customary words spoken by friends of the Night's Blessed. With the chat mode in Say, say "allin tuta" to offer Runar a traditional greeting.

You speak the greeting with your characteristic finesse, prompting Runar to bid you welcome to Slitherbough. For Zero's benefit, he also explains the significance of the greeting in a world engulfed in Light, before directing you to seek out Davith to be cleansed of Light's impurities.

You arrive just as Zero has finished undertaking the ritual, which involves washing with water blessed by priests. When Zero questions why they have retained the custom even though night has returned, Davith states that it still serves as a prayer for the safety of friends and visitors. Satisfied, Zero makes her way back to Runar, and you and Ryne follow.

Though she is unsure how or why, Zero confesses that taking part in the traditions of the Night's Blessed have left her feeling more confident in your purpose. Nevertheless, even should you triumph over Golbez and Zeromus, the fate of the void would remain unchanged...or would it? Before you can ponder the question, you are contacted by Lyna, who informs you that the preparations at the Crystarium are complete and bids you make your way to Nabaath Areng. You are to rendezvous with Cassard at Twine, as the merchant can guide you to the site of the Flood as well as ideal locations for the placement of aether transmitters.

Together with Ryne and Zero, you place transmitters in Amh Araeng at the site of the Flood. As the devices whir to life and begin extracting energy from the nearby crystal, Zero finds herself transfixed by the Lightâ”€and abruptly extends her hand in an attempt to draw the Light into herself. The strain of it causes her to faint, but with Ryne's assistance, she succeeds in harnessing the primordial energy. With newfound hope for the Thirteenth, the three of you return to the Crystarium.

The time is come for you to return to the Source. To that end, Zero leaves to have Beq Lugg transfer her back into the spirit vessel. You can but hope that the brands keeping Golbez and Zeromus at bay have held in your absence...
