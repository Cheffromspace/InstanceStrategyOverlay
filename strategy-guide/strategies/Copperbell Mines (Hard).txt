Here is the cleaned up text for the Copperbell Mines (Hard) strategy guide:

Copperbell Mines (Hard) is a level 50 dungeon introduced in patch 2.1.

Objectives:
Clear the Screaming Dark
Clear the Crying Dark  
Defeat Ouranos

Bosses:

Hecatoncheir Mastermind
Hecatoncheir Mastermind will use Darkfire every 45 - 60 seconds. The fire will cover a portion of the platform, forcing players to move further down the bridge. Whenever Hecatoncheir uses Darkfire, a Flambeau (bomb type monster) spawns at the end of the path. The Flambeau will attempt to move towards the fire. Kill the Flambeau ASAP. If it reaches the burning ground, it will explode and kill all players. If it is left alone it will self-destruct and wipe the party. Stun the bomb if necessary.

Gogmagolem and Biggy
Gogmagolem is a spriggan operating a rock giant. One party member should operate the Improved Blasting Device to spawn a Waymaker Bomb, pick it up, and drop it in the path of the Gogmagolem when it's about to explode. This is the main way to damage the boss. Kill the Kindling Sprites that spawn. When the Golem dies, kill Biggy and avoid the large exploding bombs.  

Ouranos
Avoid the boss's circular AoE attacks and kill Giga adds when they spawn. When the "abyss worm is searching for fodder" message appears, pick up a Crystallized Rock and place it in the sand to distract the Sand Worm. If not done, it will cast Bottomless Desert, pulling all players to the middle and dealing heavy damage.
