Here is the cleaned up strategy guide for A Relic Reborn: The Hydra:

Strategy
Hydra Abilities:
- Dissever: Instant attack that deals a small amount of damage.
- Triumvirate: Frontal attack that deals massive damage. Damage is reduced based on the number of players hit. 
- Mean Thrash: Rear AoE cone attack that deals large damage to all players hit. Triggered by being behind Hydra.
- White Breath: Frontal AoE breath attack that deals large damage and inflicts the Infirmity debuff, reducing healing done on target.
- Radiant Breath: All frontal AoE breath attack that deals large damage and inflicts Infirmity to all targets at medium range.
- Ball of Ice: Ice attack targeting a random player. Deals medium damage, inflicts Heavy debuff to all targets hit, and leaves a circular ice patch on the ground.
- Ball of Fire: Fireball targeting a random player. Deals large damage, inflicts Burns DoT, and leaves a circular fire patch on the ground.
- Fear Itself: AoE attack that deals large damage and inflicts Hysteria debuff to all players outside melee range, causing them to run in fear. Used after Hydra runs to the middle of the room.

Adds:
- Wyvern: Can inflict Poison DoT on its target and use Bravery to increase Hydra's damage if left alive for an extended period.

Strategy:
- Have 2 tanks stand in front of the boss to reduce Triumvirate damage. 
- Melee classes avoid White Breath attack. 
- Stand in either melee or long range to avoid Radiant Breath damage.
- Healers use Esuna to remove debuffs, but cannot cleanse Infirmity.
- Avoid Ball of Ice/Fire attacks and their ground patches. 
- Stack on top of Hydra when it runs to the center to avoid Fear Itself damage and fear.
- Tank Hydra near the wall to make its center run apparent.
- Kill Wyvern add ASAP to prevent it from buffing Hydra.
