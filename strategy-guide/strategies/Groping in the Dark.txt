Dialogue:

Estinien asks if you have fought voidsent in the Thirteenth before. He wonders why they didn't regenerate when you fought them previously. 

Zero explains that the more voidsent devour, the more powerful they grow, but their essence blends with their prey. If they lose their flesh, the souls they harbor may break free. Scarmiglione was able to resurrect swiftly, which is uncommon.

Y'shtola asks Zero about memoria, which can bind the aether of the soul in crystal. Zero is the only one left who can wield this power. 

Varshahn asks about Golbez, who may have his sister Azdaja. Zero suggests asking others in the castle about him.

You speak to voidsent on the terraces and learn that Golbez's archfiends lead armies that devour those deemed useless. With his army of minions, Golbez is very powerful and reaching him will not be easy.

Varshahn asks Zero to accompany you to find Golbez. She agrees after Varshahn offers to pay her in aether for her services. 

Zero takes you to her domain, a sanctuary where pariah voidsent have gathered. She vows to protect you there under her rule that none may succumb to their instincts and attack.
