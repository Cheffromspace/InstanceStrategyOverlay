Bosses:

Minduruva
- Manusya Bio: Tankbuster that inflicts a high damage-over-time poison. Remove immediately. 
- Manusya Blizzard III: Boss fires twelve narrow cones from the center. Stand between the marked AoEs.
- Manuysa Fire III: Large donut AoE avoided by standing near the boss.
- Manusya Thunder III: AoEs fire from front, back, left and right of boss hitbox. Move away or stand at a diagonal until they pass.
- Manusya Bio III: Covers entire room except area between boss and nearest wall. Move to unmarked side.
- Transmute versions of spells mark a location and fire an orb. Orb triggers the spell from that spot. First is always Transmute Blizzard III.
- Dhrupad: Targets non-tanks with a damage-over-time debuff. Used after every Transmute spell.

Sanduruva  
- Isitva Siddhi: Tankbuster.
- Prapti Siddhi: Fires a large line AoE at each player. Move out of markers.
- Manusya Berserk: Five orbs appear and explode in large AoEs. Getting hit inflicts Berserk debuff. Move to the gap in the ring of orbs against the wall behind it.
- Prakamya Siddhi: Point-blank AoE. Move out to avoid.
- Manusya Stop: Boss teleports to center and freezes players one at a time. Unavoidable line AoE hits each frozen player. Spread out to avoid excess damage. 
- Manusya Confuse: Boss leaps from arena, returns with five clones. Only the real one lacks an emote. Run to wall behind real boss to avoid clone explosions.

Harbingers Elect: Cinduruva/The Magus Sisters
- Starts with only Cinduruva. Other sisters join and cast Delta Attack together.
- Delta Attack varies based on text:
   - "Glacial ice, entomb our foes!" - Blizzard III 
   - "Thunderous tempest, smite our foes!" - Thunder III
   - "Insatiable flame, consume our foes!" - Fire III
- Avoid line AoEs from Sanduruva and cleanse debuffs from Minduruva. 
- Defeat Cinduruva first to prevent her reviving sisters. Then defeat remaining bosses.

Notable loot includes Manusya armor and accessories, Monstrorum weapons, a minion, orchestrion roll, and a guaranteed card from the last boss. Treasure coffers contain additional gear.
