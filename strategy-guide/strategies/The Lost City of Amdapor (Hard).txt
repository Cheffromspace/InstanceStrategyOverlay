Following the defeat of Diabolos, the unnatural pall choking the crumbling city of Amdapor was lifted, and tranquility restored to the Twelveswood. Or so it had seemed. When the Hearers entered the ruins, however, they had scarce begun consigning the stones to the forest when their elemental allies fled in a sudden panic. By the spirits' agitated whispers did the Seedseers learn that a daunting and hostile presence yet lingered within Amdapor's moldering walls. Unable to complete their ritual of cleansing, once more have the Padjals called upon your aid. Once more must you delve deep inside the ancient city's husk, and purge its withered heart of an unknown evil...

Bosses:

Achamoth
- Psycho Squamae: Targets a random player and starts casting a conal AoE in front of the boss aimed at the player.
- Neura Squamae: Spawns ghosts of the players at their current positions that occasionally cast Enthrallment. Players should look at the walls of the arena to avoid AoEs in the center.
- Toxic Squamae: Targets a random player and creates a toxic cloud that tethers to them. If the cloud reaches the player, it explodes, inflicting Vulnerability Up, damage, and creates a damaging puddle. Run around until the cloud dissipates.
- Enthrallment: The spawned ghosts cast a frontal cone AoE where the players were looking when it was cast.

Winged Lion
- Ancient Aero: Targets a random area with a large circular AoE that leaves a wind orb. The orb grows and increases damage before exploding. Step in it to detonate it early.
- Ancient Stone: Targets 2 players with circular AoEs that work the same as Ancient Aero. 
- Ancient Holy: Boss becomes untargetable and casts a circular AoE. An Arcane Sphere spawns that grows and explodes, dealing massive damage. Kill it immediately. Adds spawn from the second cast onwards but the Sphere is priority.
- Ancient Libra: Arena-wide AoE damage and randomly gives Wind or Earth Resistance Down to each player.

Kuribu
- Starts with 2 stacks of Seed of Life, reviving her upon death and granting Vulnerability Down. Also has permanent Stun Resistance.
- Abilities change based on Stance (normal or Reverse). Pay attention to effects.
- Glory: Frontal cone AoE on tank.
- Cure IV: Light circle removes spikes and reduces healing based on players inside. Dark circle is proximity AoE, stay at edges.
- Regen: Normal is buff on boss, move her out. Reverse is persistent ground AoE that inflicts Bleeding, stay out.
- Cure III: Marks two players with large AoEs, spread out.
- Decoy: Spawns adds that either tether to a player and inflict debuffs or tether to boss and heal her. Kill adds first.
- Reverse: Switches effects of some abilities to harm players instead of heal boss.

The duty also features several treasure coffers containing additional loot. Achievements are available for discovering all locations and completing certain objectives within the dungeon.
