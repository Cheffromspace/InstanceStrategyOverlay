Strategy

Auspice: Byakko
Players enter a circular arena and witness Byakko's transformation from a White Tiger into a humanoid form. The outer edges are safe during the first and second phases, but not during the transitional Free-Fall Phase.

Phase 1
- Storm Pulse: unavoidable raid-wide AoE
- Heavenly Strike: tankbuster, mitigate with defensive cooldowns
- State of Shock: two-part mechanic where Byakko grabs main target, stack marker forms opposite side for group to absorb slam damage, happens twice in a row, split into two groups
- Unrelenting Anguish: Byakko fires spiral of red orbs, avoid collision, tank/healer/DPS marked with Ominous Wind debuff that explodes if they move close together
- Fire & Lightning: massive column AoE, move out of red telegraph
- Hakutei (Tiger): off-tank picks up White Tiger add, turn away from party
- Aramata: two random players drop AoE puddles causing bleed, move to edges
- Distant Clap: doughnut AoE, move to opposite end or into Byakko, tank moves White Tiger to edge
- Roar of Thunder: unavoidable AoE based on White Tiger's health, pop Aramata Orbs before they reach center

Free-Fall Transition
Raid launched into air, avoid outer ring, Byakko's orbs, doughnut AoEs by moving to center, and White Tiger's line AoE. Survive to land stunned in new arena.

Phase 2
- Heavenly Strike: tankbuster on main target
- Hundredfold Havoc: outward-firing lightning AoEs, move to safe areas
- State of Shock: same as phase 1, off-tank provokes after first grab
- Sweep Of The Leg: frontal-cone AoE, no telegraph, stand behind Byakko
- Unrelenting Anguish: tank/healer/DPS marked with Gale Force expanding puddles, avoid collision
- Hakutei (Tiger): same as phase 1 with additional overlapping mechanics
- Roar of Thunder: stricter DPS check, White Tiger charges AoE based on health
- Hundredfold Havoc + Gale Force: place puddles apart to avoid wipe
- State of Shock + Sweep The Leg: tank swap, group split, move behind Byakko after slams

Byakko loops various mechanics until defeated or enrage at 12 minutes. Survives with triple Storm Pulse into raid wipe.
