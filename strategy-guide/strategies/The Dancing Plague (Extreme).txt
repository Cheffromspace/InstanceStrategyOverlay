Here is the cleaned up text for the strategy guide on The Dancing Plague (Extreme) trial in Final Fantasy 14:

The Dancing Plague (Extreme) is a level 80 trial introduced in patch 5.0 with Shadowbringers.

Overview
The battle consists of 4 phases, each incorporating various mechanics and overlapped combos. Should your team fail to kill Titania within a set amount of time, Titania will eventually wipe the raid via an unavoidable Bright Sabbath.

Phases & Abilities
Titania EX will first introduce various mechanics that will overlap with others later during the battle. Below is a list of their common abilities, followed by a list of how they happen per phase (in order).

Bright Sabbath - an unavoidable AoE which will require group-wide healing.
Phantom Rune - Titania will ask: "Can you guess which one?", indicating one of two possible mechanics that will spawn at Titania's hitbox. One is a large circular AoE (which players must run away from), while the other is a donut AoE (requiring players to stand within their hitbox). Pay attention to Titania's casting animation. If they spread their wings, this indicates the circle-AoE. If their staff begins spinning around them in a circle motion, players should move close and be ready to stand within the donut-AoE safe-spot.
Divination Rune - a vicious conal tank-buster aimed at their primary target. Tanks should turn Titania away from the group while this is being cast. 
Chain of Brambles - tethers tanks and healers to random damage-dealers, forcing them to snap the tether by stretching it as far as possible. The group should pre-plan positions for individual players to run to.

Phase 1
Titania will begin by casting Bright Sabbath followed by Phantom Rune, forcing players to move out of a circle AoE. The second Phantom Rune will involve the donut AoE. 

Mist Rune will form 8 puddles around the arena. Players must move to their assigned puddle and stand within it until the animation has completed. Failure to do so will spawn an add and leave one less puddle for the next mechanic, Flame Rune.

Flame Rune summons an unattackable Spirit of Flame which will target each Healer with a stack-marker. Players hit will suffer Fire Resistance Down II and should split evenly between both marks. 

After dealing with Flame Rune, Titania will unleash a Divination Rune on the main-tank, followed by Chain of Brambles. The battle will then transition to phase 2.

Phase 2
Thunder Rune will create a tether between Titania and a non-tank player, selecting them as the target for repeated AoE blasts which inflict Lightning Resistance Down II with each hit. The group must decide between passing the tether to a new player with each blast, or assigning a tank with an invulnerability cooldown to absorb 2-3 blasts before swapping it. 

Fae Light is a triple-cast conal tank buster in quick succession. Tanks may opt to keep their invulnerability cooldowns for this instead of Thunder Rune, or swap in between casts to share damage.

Growth Rune will mark two corners with a multi-directional star-AoE telegraph. After a delay, brambles will sprout and grow in cardinal and diagonal directions, binding victims caught for their duration and inflicting damage-over-time. Growth Rune will always leave small triangular safe-spots players must stand in to avoid being bound.

Chain of Brambles will also be cast at the same time as Growth Rune, forcing players to stretch their tether and break it before the arena is covered in brambles.

Divination Rune is cast after the above combo. The tank must be wary when repositioning Titania, as it will potentially cleave the group.

Frost Rune will spawn large white circles around the arena, starting with one in the center. Circles will then spawn clockwise or counter-clockwise around the edges and explode in the order they spawned. By standing in the circles that spawned late, players can move towards the center once earlier circles have exploded. 

Uplift will drop circular AoE markers on all participants, forcing them to spread around the arena.

Phantom Rune is the last mechanic of the phase and will create either a circular or donut AoE.

Phase 3
Titania will become invulnerable and summon three mini-bosses (Mustardseed, Puck and Peaseblossom), each with their own mechanics. Puck and Peaseblossom need to be grabbed by tanks immediately, and all three will be re-summoned into larger versions after initially being slain. Throughout the add phase, Titania will be charging their power. Should it reach 100, the raid will wipe.

Tanks should pick up Puck and Peaseblossom while Healers and DPS slay Mustardseed quickly to avoid a raid-wipe. If successful, Titania will re-summon all three adds in giant form which should be tanked and killed in the same order. 

Mini-boss mechanics will become larger, more damaging, and chaotic in this phase. The most noteworthy is Puck's Rebuke, spawning a circular telegraph in the arena center that knocks players towards the edge and can kill them outright if they stand within it. Vines will also spawn in opposite corners blasting line-AoEs across the edges. Players must quickly position to be knocked away from their tether partner to break it without being knocked into vine AoEs or off the arena.
