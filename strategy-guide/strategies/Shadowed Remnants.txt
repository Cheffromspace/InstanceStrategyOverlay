Dialogue:
The group discusses searching for Azdaja. They decide to split up and gather information from the castle's occupants. 

You learn of a clever voidsent being held in the dungeon. The group heads there to find it before other voidsent devour it.

In the dungeon, you encounter the dark-robed voidsent who was once bound to Zenos as his avatar. It has returned to its true form after being purged by Hydaelyn's crystal.

The voidsent questions what it means to be a "friend" as Zenos had called you. It agrees not to be an enemy, recognizing your strength. 

Y'shtola notes the voidsent seems different and is keen to learn more about it and the void. Finding it here was fortunate and perhaps fated.
