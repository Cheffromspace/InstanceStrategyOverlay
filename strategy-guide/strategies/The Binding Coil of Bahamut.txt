Here is the cleaned up text for the strategy guide on The Binding Coil of Bahamut:

General Information
The Binding Coil of Bahamut is the first section of The Coils of Bahamut, the level 50 8-player raids in A Realm Reborn and was the first raid tier released in the game. The Binding Coil of Bahamut requires players with item level of 82 or higher to enter. Once unlocked, the raid can be accessed from the Duty Finder → Raids → Raids (A Realm Reborn). 

Note: Because the Coils of Bahamut have a difficulty somewhere between (Extreme) and (Savage), these raids are not included in any roulette (even Mentor). As such, players queuing via Duty Finder will almost never be able to form a party.

That being the case, it is recommended that newer players use the Party Finder to seek the assistance of a couple of level-capped players for a "unsync run" using the Unrestricted Party option. This will allow players to see the story at an appropriate point in their Main Scenario Quest progression. They can also easily solo the raids with a level 80+ character.

Unlock
Players can unlock The Binding Coil of Bahamut after reaching level 50 and completing The Bowl of Embers (Hard), The Howling Eye (Hard) and The Navel (Hard).

Afterwards players can talk to Urianger in The Waking Sands (X:6.0, Y:4.9) to start the Bahamut Quests chain with a quest titled Primal Awakening and unlock the raids. 

Players may proceed to any of the five floors in this raid tier after unlocking them, although the floors are intended to be done in order for story purposes. To continue the questline, complete The Binding Coil of Bahamut - Turn 5 to unlock Alisaie's Pledge.
