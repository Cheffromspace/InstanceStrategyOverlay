Bosses:

Hedetet
- Take note of the four white crystals jutting from the ground, as these serve as shields for some of the boss's attacks. The crystals explode after being hit by one of Hedetet's attacks. New crystals fall from the ceiling, but be prepared to move out of their way.
- Crystal Needle: Tankbuster. 
- Hailfire: Places a crosshair on a random target. After a short delay, Hedetet blasts sand at the targeted player, damaging the first thing it hits. Standing behind a crystal blocks all damage.
- Shardfall: Arena-wide AoE. Stand behind a crystal to protect yourself. Hedetet casts Dissonance immediately after this attack.
- Dissonance: Another arena-wide AoE. This time the safe zone is inside Hedetet's hitbox. Deals high damage and inflicts Vulnerability Up if it connects.
- Shardstrike: Places an AoE marker on all players. Spread out to avoid damage overlap, but also position as to not hit any of the crystals.

Defective Drone
- The arena is smaller than most, and the left and right sides are constantly burning, inflicting Burns. Take note of the "lanes" the arena is separated into. 
- Aetherochemical Flame: High party-wide damage. Mitigate and heal through this.
- Aetherochemical Coil: Tankbuster that hits an arc in front of the boss. 
- Full Throttle: The Defective Drone moves out of the arena with five smaller Mining Drones on one side. Determine which drone is sparking without lights above it, and move into its lane. Getting run over inflicts massive damage and knockback into the fire.
- Rock Busters: Summons Rock Busters on the sides that launch across in a straight line. Don't stand in front of them.
- After a while, the boss summons a Repurposed Dreadnaught with standard Dreadnaught attacks.

Mist Dragon
- Rime Wreath: High party-wide damage, mitigate and heal through. The Mist Dragon spams this when not casting anything else.
- Frost Breath: Two distinct attacks. The first targets a non-tank, damaging everything in a line. The second marks the tank and hits a wide arc. Ice puddles appear in the hit areas. Inflicts dispellable Frostbite. 
- Fog Plume: Star AoE on a random target. Four arena-wide line AoEs originate from the first attack's landing point. Later targets two players, trapping those hit in blocks of Mist ice.
- Vaporize: The Mist Dragon turns into mist in the center. Three Draconic Regard adds spawn and tether to it. Attacking the dragon causes a counterattack freezing the player.
- Cold Fog: Expanding AoE centered on the dragon's misty form. Slaying the adds prevents further expansion.
- Deep Fog: The arena is shrouded in fog inflicting Dropsy. The dragon sprays ice through the center, freezing anyone hit. It swoops twice before the fog disperses. Run around the edge until orange AoE indicators appear to dodge.
- Touchdown: A proximity marker indicates where the dragon will slam down. Free anyone trapped and move to the opposite side.
