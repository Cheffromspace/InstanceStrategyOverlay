Here is the cleaned up version of the strategy guide for The Vault dungeon in Final Fantasy XIV:

The Vault is a level 57 dungeon introduced in patch 3.0 with Heavensward. With the addition of Duty Support in patch 6.2, changes to progression and bosses were implemented.

Objectives:
1. Defeat Ser Adelphel.
2. Defeat Ser Grinnaux. 
3. Defeat Ser Charibert.

Bosses:

Ser Adelphel Brightblade
- Starts with 3 low health adds. When Adelphel reaches 30%, he will change forms and begin the true encounter.
- Holy Shield Bash: Targets one player, jumps to them, and performs a stun and hit combo.
- Holiest of Holy: Deals moderate damage to every player.
- Adelphel will charge around the room, leaving damaging orbs of light. He will then target a player and crash down on them.

Ser Grinnaux The Bull  
- Starts with trivial health pool before changing forms and unleashing his full potential.
- Uses multiple ground AOEs to avoid.
- Hyperdimensional Slash: Lays out a red AOE in the direction of a random player, leaving an Aetherial Tear where it hits the wall. Repeated twice. Bait Tears close together.
- Faith Unmoving: Room-wide attack that pushes players directly backward from Grinnaux. Avoid being pushed into Tears.
- Dimensional Rift: Circle AOE that damages players.

Ser Charibert
- Starts at full power with no phase changes.
- Altar Pyre: Room-wide damage. 
- Holy Chain: Chains two players together. Run apart to break the chain.
- Heavensflame: Puts out flame rings on the ground. 
- Summons marching "knights" that inflict Slow if run over.
- At half health, disappears and returns with Dawn/Dusk Knights and Holy Flames. Ignore Knights, kill Flames before Charibert's room-wide attack. Normal rotation resumes with two rows of knights and flame rings.

The guide then lists the loot that can be obtained from each boss and treasure coffers. It also mentions relevant achievements and provides some lore background on the dungeon and bosses.
