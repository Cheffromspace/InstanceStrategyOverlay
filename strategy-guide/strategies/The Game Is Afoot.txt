Walkthrough:
This quest contains a solo instance that takes place in the Aetherfont. At the start, move forward and defeat the two groups of enemies on the path, then talk to the Hard-pressed Surveyor. Take the zipline to the next area, then go right and talk to the Concerned Researcher. The nearby gate will open, revealing an area that was previously inaccessible in the dungeon instance. 

Defeat the enemies past the gate, then interact with the Beast Carcass further ahead (14.1, 13.1). Head to the eastern part of the area and interact with the Tattered Plumage (14.6, 14.9). Continue southwest and interact with the Animal Leavings (13.2, 15.4), which will also spawn some enemies. Return to the researchers behind the gate, which triggers a cutscene, then a boss.

Giant Colibri:
You will be accompanied by G'raha Tia and Wuk Lamat during this battle.
- Wind Unbound: Unavoidable party-wide magical damage. 
- Snatch Morsel: Tankbuster.
- Pecking Flurry: Unavoidable party-wide physical damage and sequentially spawns three sets of circular AoEs that cover the entire arena. Move into the first set of AoE telegraphs once they go off.
- Sticky Spit: Stack marker on the player that inflicts Sticky, preventing all movement and actions. The boss will begin casting Gliding Spit, a line AoE. However, Wuk Lamat will escape the slime and pull both you and G'raha Tia to safety.
- The boss uses Pecking Flurry again followed by Swoop, a line AoE charge in front of it with a brief telegraph.
- Furling Flapping: Spread AoE telegraphs on everyone. This attack will knock everyone up and incapacitate them with Fetters (tornadoes). 
- The boss begins casting Gliding Spit again, then a very brief active time maneuver will start. Once you break out of the tornado, defeat the other two tornadoes to free your allies before they are hit with the attack.
- Ruffling of Feathers: The boss becomes untargetable and begins hitting the party with Full-fledged Tantrum, unavoidable magical damage. Its two wings (Left Wing and Right Wing) will become targetable. G'raha Tia will heal during this sequence. Wuk Lamat will destroy both wings with a limit-break-esque AoE.
Once this sequence is over, finish off the boss.

Steps:
1. Speak with Wuk Lamat at the Scholar's Harbor near the entrance to The Aetherfont.
2. Speak with Erenville.
3. Speak with Dickon at The Last Stand.
4. Speak with Erenville.

Journal:
As you deliberate a suitable location for Wuk Lamat's hunt, Erenville mentions a petition for aid from researchers on the Isle of Haam. Some manner of predator has unsettled ordinarily docile animals, causing them to behave savagely, and the task involves identifying and dealing with the creature. Seeing an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, you all make your way to Scholar's Harbor to secure passage with the exception of Krile, who promises to join you at the isle after she has seen to her preparations.
