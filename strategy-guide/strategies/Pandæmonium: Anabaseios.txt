Lore

The serene expanse of the aetherial sea is marred by the sudden appearance of Pandæmonium, which has crossed eons to threaten the source of life itself. Its walls loom unmanned, but you know well what horrors once lay beyond them, and in the silence can hear a stirring...

Trivia

- Anabaseios (ἀνάβασις) is Ancient Greek for "the ascent."
- This is also the first raid tier in which all bosses have voice acting.
