Here is the cleaned up text for the Eden's Promise strategy guide:

Eden's Promise is the 3rd section of Eden, the main 8-player raid in Shadowbringers. Released on December 8, 2020, Eden's Promise requires players with item level of 485 or higher to enter. Once unlocked, the raid can be queued from the Duty Finder.

Unlock

Players must first complete all of the Eden Quests up through Life Finds a Way. This includes clearing all of the Eden's Gate and Eden's Verse raids. Completion of patch 5.3 MSQ Reflections in Crystal is also required.

Players can then begin the level 80 quest chain starting with Worlds Apart by talking to Yalfort in Amh Araeng (X:26.8, Y:16.7).  

To unlock each floor after the first, continue the quest line and complete the consecutive floor. Each floor is listed separately.
